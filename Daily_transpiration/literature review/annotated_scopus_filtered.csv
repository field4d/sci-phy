Managing water and crop planning relies heavily on precise forecasting of ETo. This research used a novel time series decomposition technique, Empirical Fourier Decomposition (EFD), to forecast ETo accurately. Four machine learning techniques were used to forecast ETo using decomposed lagged ETo values. The input data source was from Prince Edward Island (PEI) weather stations (Harrington and St Peters Stations). First, autocorrelation analysis was performed to determine effective lags. Then, ETo data were decomposed using EFD, and lagged data was created based on EFD results. The Kbest feature selection algorithm was used to choose effective inputs, reducing the training time. The accuracy of models was evaluated using different statistical metrics such as correlation coefficient (R) and root mean square error (RMSE). The results showed that using EFD decomposition can significantly improve forecast accuracy. The comparison between different machine learning models showed that the deep learning-based model (Bidirectional LSTM (Long Short Term Memory)) (R = 0.956, RMSE= 0.451 mm/day for Harrington station and R = 0.956, RMSE= 0.451 mm/day for St Peters station) performed better than the Generalized Regression Neural Network (GRNN), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), and Random Forest (RF) models. Finally, the best model (EFD-Bidirectional LSTM) was used to forecast multitemporal ETo at both stations. Results showed that the developed model can forecast ETo for up to 28 days with reasonable accuracy. However, the accuracy of multi-step ahead forecasting decreases when evapotranspiration values are high, as the models tend to underestimate these values. The findings of this study can assist in accurately calculating crop water requirements and help farmers optimize their irrigation schedules. © 2024 The Author(s)",Climate adaptation; Deep learning; Empirical fourier decomposition; Evapotranspiration; Feature selection; Machine learning,,Yes,Yes,weather station,climate & meteorology,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

We attributed the impact of multitemporal landsat-derived land use/land cover change (LULCC) on temperature and precipitation variability in eastern South Africa using reanalysis data and satellite-derived estimates from 1979 to 2020. Landsat images were classified into different land cover classes using a machine learning random forest pixel-based supervised algorithm within the cloud-based Google Earth Engine. Time series analysis was employed to analyze cycles and trends in LULCC and hydrometeorological variables, whilst the variable importance model determined the most sensitive variable. The impacts of LULCC on the boundary layer climate were attributed via multiple linear regression. An uninterrupted rapid expansion of urban areas was observed, resulting in the transformation of grasslands, water bodies, forests, and croplands. Statistically significant changes in moisture and energy fluxes, and hydrometeorological variables were observed across the study period. Latent heat flux (LHF), as well as rainfall decreased, while maximum temperature, sensible heat, and potential evapotranspiration (PET) increased significantly. We found that LULCC is significantly impacting the boundary layer climate, with urban and bare land, grasslands, forests, and croplands influencing temperature positively while negatively influencing rainfall. Rainfall was most sensitive to changes in LHF, whilst the key driver of temperature variability was PET. Our results reinforce the significance of LULCC and associated feedbacks to understanding boundary layer processes, climate variability, and change. © Indian Academy of Sciences 2024.",climate variability and change; LULCC; planetary boundary layer; random forest; surface moisture and energy fluxes; variable importance,South Africa; algorithm; bare soil; boundary layer; climate change; energy flux; escarpment; evapotranspiration; forest; grassland; land cover; land use change; Landsat; latent heat flux; machine learning; moisture; multiple regression; precipitation (climatology); rainfall; temperature; time series analysis; urban area,Yes,Yes,"weather station, remote sensing","climate & meteorology, vegetation indices",0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0

To achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), food security must be prioritized. Rice yield has been predicted using Cubist, GBM, MARS, RF, SVM, and XGB machine learning methods, considering six factors: elevation, soil moisture, precipitation, temperature, soil temperature, and actual evapotranspiration. Climatic change scenarios were generated using the latest climatic Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6 MIROC6) Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP) 2–4.5 and SSP5-8.5 datasets between 1990 and 2030. Finally, machine learning algorithms were used to identify rice yield gaps to achieve sustainable agricultural intensification. The rice yield validation was completed with 1889 field-based farmer observation records. The results suggest that Murshidabad and Purba Bardhaman districts had very high rice yields (5.60–3.45 t/ha) when using the Cubist model compared to another model. The findings also reveal a poor rice-yielding zone (1.44–0.39 t/ha) in the western region (Purulia) and a northwestern region (half of the west of Birbhum). The Cubist and RF models' maximum and minimum R2 values were 0.73 and 0.72, respectively. The R2 values were also negligible for the XGB, GBM, SVM, and MARS, machine learning models. Projections for rice production in 2030 indicate that the northern and north-eastern regions (Murshidabad and Purba Bardhaman) as well as the southeastern areas (Jhargram and Paschim Medinipur) have the highest yields, categorized as extremely very high (5.56–3.49 t/ha) and high (3.49–2.49 t/ha). A significant rice yield gap (50-40 %) was found in the center and south-east areas (Bankura, Jhargram, and Paschim Medinipur), the northern region (Murshidabad and Birbhum), and the western region (Purulia). In 2030, the north-western region (Birbhum), as well as the middle and south-eastern regions (Bankura, Jhargram, and Paschim Medinipur districts), had the highest proportion of high (50%–40 %) and very high (60%–50 %) rice yield gap. Our findings can contribute to a new viewpoint on agricultural planning and management for sustainable growth in the face of changing climate circumstances. © 2024 The Authors",Food security; Machine learning; Remote sensing; Rice yield gap,,Yes,Yes,Not Specified,"climate & meteorology, vegetation indices, soil",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0

Therefore, it is crucial to further explore vegetation dynamics and diverse change trajectories in this region under future climate scenarios to obtain a more comprehensive understanding of local ecosystem evolution. In this study, we established an integrated machine learning prediction framework and a vegetation change trajectory recognition framework to predict the dynamics of vegetation in Central Asia under future climate change scenarios and identify its change trajectories, thus revealing the potential impacts of future climate change on vegetation in the region. The findings suggest that various future climate scenarios will negatively affect most vegetation in Central Asia, with vegetation change intensity increasing with increasing emission trajectories. Analyses of different time scales and trend variations consistently revealed more pronounced downward trends. Vegetation change trajectory analysis revealed that most vegetation has undergone nonlinear and dramatic changes, with negative changes outnumbering positive changes and curve changes outnumbering abrupt changes. Under the highest emission scenario (SSP5-8.5), the abrupt vegetation changes and curve changes are 1.7 times and 1.3 times greater, respectively, than those under the SSP1-2.6 scenario. When transitioning from lower emission pathways (SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5) to higher emission pathways (SSP3-7.0, SSP5-8.5), the vegetation change trajectories shift from neutral and negative curve changes to abrupt negative changes. Across climate scenarios, the key climate factors influencing vegetation changes are mostly evapotranspiration and soil moisture, with temperature and relative humidity exerting relatively minor effects. Our study reveals the negative response of vegetation in Central Asia to climate change from the perspective of vegetation dynamics and change trajectories, providing a scientific basis for the development of effective ecological protection and climate adaptation strategies. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.",Central asia; Change trajectory; Climate change; Machine learning; Vegetation estimation,Asia; Climate Change; Ecosystem; Machine Learning; Plants; Central Asia; Abiotic; Anthropogenic; Central Asia; Change trajectory; Future climate; Future climate scenarios; Machine-learning; Pattern analysis; Trajectory pattern; Vegetation change; Vegetation dynamics; Vegetation estimation; climate change; climate effect; machine learning; trajectory; vegetation dynamics; article; central Asia; climate change; controlled study; evapotranspiration; greenhouse effect; machine learning; prediction; soil moisture; temperature; vegetation; vegetation dynamics; Asia; ecosystem; machine learning; plant; Adversarial machine learning,Yes,Yes,Not Specified,"climate & meteorology, vegetation indices, soil",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0

Various levels of deficit irrigation were conducted in the vegetative, reproductive, and mature stages. Our research indicated that soil CO2 fluxes from 100% evapotranspiration treatment (Tr1) were significantly greater than various deficit irrigation treatments (Tr2, Tr3, Tr4) during each growth stage of summer maize. The cumulative soil CO2 fluxes of Tr2, Tr3, and Tr4 decreased 24.8%, 30.3%, and 43.7% compared with Tr1, respectively. We determined that the drivers affecting the daily RS were soil temperature at 5 cm depth (TS,5) and soil surface temperature (TSF), followed by water-filled porosity (WFPS) at 5 cm depth, but no significant correlations were observed at 25 cm depths. TS,5 and TSF also performed similar correlation with seasonal RS with R greater than 0.753 among all water treatments, followed by chlorophyll content with R greater than 0.726. During the whole growing season, the BPNN model exhibited the best predicting result, and could explain the 60%–80% and 87.8% of the variations of RS at the daily and seasonal scales, with root mean square error of 48.7–100.9 mg m−2 h−1 and 91.5 mg m−2 h−1, respectively. The SVR and MNR models could estimate the 47.9%–57% and 39.9%–52.1% of the daily RS and 81.4% and 78.6% of the seasonal RS, respectively. Overall, our study indicated the machine learning algorithms could be successfully applied to estimate RS at daily and seasonal scales from a maize field under water stress condition. © 2024 The Author(s).

Traditional approaches, including eddy covariance and remote sensing-based energy balance methods, often struggle with high costs, limited spatial and temporal coverage, and reduced predictive accuracy, particularly for classical empirical models. While machine learning has emerged as a promising alternative, it still presents challenges, notably in underestimating ETₐ during periods of high heat. We attribute this to insufficient learning on the rare but highly relevant ETₐ values of interest, or the not-so-big climatic datasets available for use. In this manuscript, we demonstrate how few-shot, meta-learning models (MAML) that are specifically designed for enhanced generalizability on not-so-big datasets can outperform basic machine learning models in upscaling ETₐ from two major in-situ towers, the Ameriflux and Euroflux. Using limited remotely sensed land surface data from the METRIC-EEFlux and limited climatic variables, we demonstrate that the chosen models can attain quantifiable utility within the utility-based-regression paradigm towards impactful practical considerations. Our initial explorations reveal that EEflux ETₐ deviates significantly from in-situ observations measured through the Ameriflux and EEflux towers (R2=39%). Instead, MAML shows best performance in approximating ETₐ than basic machine learning algorithms and EEFlux (R2=71% on entire testing dataset, R2=0.88 on the Csa climate, R2=0.79 on the Cfa climate, and R2=0.78 on the CSH vegetation class), and continues to improve without overfitting even when exposed to a relatively small training dataset. Its high F2 score (96 %) indicates that MAML has very high precision and recall for rare cases, which is significant for irrigation. Of independent interest, this study confirms that limited remotely sensed EEflux products contribute significantly to knowledge about ground truth ETₐ and can thus be of valuable use in settings where access to good quality and high-volume data is compromised. © 2024 The Authors",Artificial intelligence; EEFlux; Evapotranspiration; Machine learning,Adversarial machine learning; Evapotranspiration; Resource allocation; Water management; Zero-shot learning; Actual evapotranspiration; AmeriFlux; Eddy covariance; Eeflux; Machine-learning; Meta-learning models; Meta-learning techniques; Traditional approaches; Traditional approachs; Water resources management; Contrastive Learning,Yes,Yes,"eddy covariance, remote sensing","climate & meteorology, vegetation indices",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0

The geoscience community faces a dilemma of reconciling process comprehension with high predictive accuracy. Here we introduce a deep process learning (DPL) approach empowering neural networks to deduce intrinsic processes from observable data, wherein the intuitive physics of geosystems is directly coupled within the deep learning (DL) architecture as structural prior. We aim to incorporate as raw common concepts as possible as macroscopic guidance: on the one hand, to reduce interference with DL's data adaptability. On the other hand, to allow the information flow of the model to converge along specific paths toward the target output, thus enabling the potential to gain process insights with limited supervision. Illustrating its application to precipitation-runoff modeling across the USA, DPL yields an ensemble median Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency of 0.758 and Kling-Gupta efficiency of 0.778 with robust transferability, compared to 0.762 and 0.751 for the state-of-the-art DL model. The good match between internal representations of DPL and independent data sets of snow water equivalent and evapotranspiration, along with its superior capability for catchment water budget closures, demonstrates proficient process mastery. The study also highlights beneficial synergies from large-scale data collaboration, promoting the organic unity of process understanding and predictive performance. This work shows a promising avenue for learning processes from big data and will benefit geoscientific domains that remain concerned with process clarity in the era of AI. © 2024.

22,Addis A.; Gessesse A.A.,"Downscaling MODIS evapotranspiration into finer resolution using machine learning approach on a small scale, Ribb watershed, Ethiopia",2024,10.1007/s10661-024-13313-7,"By monitoring evapotranspiration (ET), the exchange of water and energy between the soil, plants, and the atmosphere can be controlled. Routine estimations of ET on a daily, monthly, and seasonal basis can give relevant information on small-scale agricultural practices, such as the Ribb watershed in Ethiopia. However, MODIS sensors have recently given high temporal resolution ET products across large areas, but their low spatial resolution limits its application on a local scale. The primary goal of the study was to downscale the MODIS ET (1 km) product to a finer spatial resolution at the watershed level. The model’s 12 predictor variables (NDVI, EVI, LAI, FVC, SAVI, NDMI, NDWI, Albedo, emissivity, LST, and DEM: slope and elevation) were produced using the random forest (RF) algorithm using Sentinel-2 (S-2) 20 m and Landsat-8 (L-8) 30 m. The RF regression model was used to assess the relationship between predicted variables and downscaled MODIS ET. The FAO-PM ET model, developed from meteorological stations, was validated by R2 and RMSE for three seasons (rainy, post-rainy, and dry) in 2022. The results were in good agreement with MODIS ET, with an RMSE of 0.22 for S-2 and 0.28 for L-8. In the FAO-PM ET model, the downscaled result showed greater spatial details and better agreement with gage station readings (R2≈0.88 and 0.82). Thus, considering the effectiveness and simplicity of machine learning techniques, our study demonstrated the potential for ET downscaling. Furthermore, the study suggests integrating spatiotemporal time series data to reach higher resolution. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.",Downscale; Evapotranspiration; Landsat-8; MODIS; Random forest; Ribb watershed; Sentinel-2,Agriculture; Environmental Monitoring; Ethiopia; Machine Learning; Plant Transpiration; Satellite Imagery; Seasons; Ethiopia; Decision trees; Deforestation; Fertilizers; Regression analysis; Down-scaling; Downscale; Ethiopia; LANDSAT; Landsat-8; MODIS; Random forests; Ribb watershed; Sentinel-2; Small scale; algorithm; downscaling; estimation method; evapotranspiration; Landsat thematic mapper; machine learning; MODIS; sensor; Sentinel; spatial resolution; watershed; agricultural parameters; algorithm; analysis; Article; atmosphere; data analysis; data source; enhance vegetation index; Ethiopia; evapotranspiration; geographical variation (species); human; image analysis; lake; machine learning; meteorology; moisture; mountain; operational landsat imagery; qualitative analysis; quantitative analysis; random forest; remote sensing; root mean squared error; shuttle radar topography mission; software; soil; spatial analysis; vapor pressure; vegetation; agriculture; environmental monitoring; Ethiopia; evapotranspiration; procedures; satellite imagery; season; Evapotranspiration,Yes,Yes,"weather station, remote sensing, empirical models","climate & meteorology, vegetation indices",0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0

Precipitation influences the physiology and growth of species, while temperature regulates photosynthesis, respiration, and transpiration. This study developed bioclimatic models to assess how climate change will affect the carbon density of aboveground biomass (cdAGB) in Mexico’s coniferous forests for 2050 and 2070. We used cdAGB data from the National Forest and Soils Inventory (INFyS) of Mexico and 19 bioclimatic variables from WorldClim ver. 2.0. The best predictors of cdAGB were obtained using machine learning techniques with the “caret” library in R. The model was trained with 80% of the data and validated with the remaining 20% using Generalized Linear Models (GLMs). Current cdAGB prediction maps were generated using the best predictors. Future cdAGB was calculated with the average of three general circulation models (GCMs) of future climate projections from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5), under four Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs): 2.6, 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5 W/m2. The results indicate cdAGB losses in all climate scenarios, reaching up to 15 Mg C ha−1, and could occur under the RCP 8.5 scenario by 2070 in the central region of the country. Temperature-related variables are more important than precipitation variables. Bioclimatic variables can explain up to 20% of the total variance in cdAGB. The temperature in the study area is expected to increase by 2.66 °C by 2050 and 3.36 °C by 2070, while precipitation is expected to fluctuate by ±10% relative to the current values, which could geographically redistribute the cdAGB of the country’s coniferous forests. These findings underscore the need for forest management to focus not only on biodiversity conservation but also on the carbon storage capacity of these ecosystems. © 2024 by the authors.",aboveground biomass; bioclimatic models; climate change; coniferous forests; machine learning,Biomass; Carbon; Data; Forests; Models; Precipitation; Temperature; Variables; Mexico [North America]; Anthropogenic; Forest ecology; Aboveground biomass; Aboveground live biomass; Bioclimatic models; Bioclimatic variables; Carbon density; Climate variation; Coniferous forests; Future climate; Machine-learning; Me-xico; aboveground biomass; bioclimatology; biodiversity; carbon emission; climate change; climate effect; climate modeling; climate variation; CMIP; coniferous forest; machine learning; mapping; Biotic,Yes,Yes,Not Specified,"climate & meteorology, vegetation indices, plant physiology",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1

For instance, different soil water limitation functions lead to wide productivity ranges across models. To address this, we propose the Differentiable Land Model (DifferLand), a novel hybrid machine learning approach replacing unknown water limitation functions in models with neural networks (NNs) to learn from data. Using automatic differentiation, we calibrated the embedded NN and the physical model parameters against daily observations of evapotranspiration, gross primary productivity, ecosystem respiration, and leaf area index across 16 FLUXNET sites. We evaluated six model configurations where NNs simulate increasingly complex soil water and photosynthesis interactions against test data sets to find the optimal structure-performance tradeoff. Our findings show that a simple hybrid model with a univariate NN effectively captures site-level water and carbon fluxes on a monthly timescale. Across a global aridity gradient, the magnitude of water stress limitation varies, but its functional form consistently converges to a piecewise linear relationship with saturation at high water levels. While models incorporating more interactions between soil water and meteorological drivers better fit observations at finer time scales, they risk overfitting and equifinality issues. Our study demonstrates that hybrid models have great potential in learning unknown parameterizations and testing ecological hypotheses. Nevertheless, careful structure-performance tradeoffs are warranted in light of observational constraints to translate the retrieved relationships into robust process understanding. © 2024 The Author(s).

Study focus: Accurate estimation of crop water use or actual evapotranspiration (AET) remains a key obstacle in the effective design of irrigation schedules, plans, and design. This is due to the non-linear nature of this phenomenon. To address this issue and guarantee more accurate ET predictions, this study attempts the following: i) to assess the performance of five machine learning (ML) models optimized by the RReliefF algorithm in estimating actual ET values for each month in four Chinese provinces under various agroclimatic conditions; and ii) to select the optimal model based on statistical metrics while minimizing discrepancies between the estimated and actual ET values. AET was estimated using support vector machine (SVM), ensemble bagged and boosted trees, robust linear regression (RLR), and Matern 5/2 Gaussian process regression (M-GPR) models. New hydrological insights for the region: The M-GPR model outperformed the other models and generated the best values for all statistical measures for training and testing stages: R2 (0.979, 0.982), RMSE (5.56, 5.09), MAE (3.29,3.16). In comparison, the RLR model exhibited the lowest training and testing performances metrics. The results of this study demonstrate the capacity of the M-GPR model to accurately predict long-term AET values. This model is best suited for further research on AET prediction at the stations under investigation, which could improve irrigation and boost agricultural productivity. © 2024 The Authors",Actual evapotranspiration; Ensemble trees; Feature importance; Irrigation management; Matern GPR,,Yes,Yes,Not Specified,climate & meteorology,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

In this study, we conducted an analysis based on the Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) model using Local Data Assimilation and Prediction System (LDAPS) data, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) from VIIRS and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and FluxNet ground observations of the Cheorwon rice paddy region. This was used to estimate methane emissions from rice paddy fields in South Korea and to create a gridded spatial information map of methane concentrations. Using data with a spatial resolution of 1.5 kilometers, we identified detailed changes within the region and generated daily maps to analyze daily changes and seasonal characteristics. To predict methane concentration, we considered the correlation between meteorological factors such as latent heat flux, humidity, soil moisture, and soil temperature and methane emissions as key variables. Latent heat flux and humidity were selected as key variables considering that the migration of methane gas is affected by the evapotranspiration process. In addition, soil moisture, which creates the anaerobic conditions necessary for methane production, and soil temperature, which affects the activity of methanogenic microorganisms, were included in the analysis. Taking these various factors into consideration, we analyzed methane emission data from rice fields in Korea and visualized them on a map to understand the pattern of methane production in response to changing weather conditions. The developed model showed a correlation coefficient of 0.91 and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 28.97 in the 5-fold cross-validation and an average correlation coefficient of 0.87 and MAE of 35.46 in the Leave One Year Out (LOYO) cross-validation. These results are expected to contribute to the understanding of methane generation patterns under changing weather conditions and accurate methane emission estimation. In addition, the developed model and the constructed methane concentration map can be utilized as an important basis for establishing greenhouse gas reduction policies in the agricultural sector and effective climate change response strategies in the future.

To build the dataset, 401 samples were collected from two fields in Prince Edward Island (PEI) and 122 samples from the New Brunswick (NB), Canada. In addition, soil moisture (SM), temperature (ST), and electrical conductivity (EC), alongside eight climatic variables including wind speed (WS), solar radiation (SR), relative humidity (RH), precipitation (PCP), air temperature (AT), dew point (DP), vapour pressure difference (VPD) and reference evapotranspiration (ETo) were also collected. Greedy stepwise (GS) approach was implemented for feature selection. Finally, different qualitative (scatter plot, line graph, Taylor diagram, box plot, and Rug plot), and quantitative (uncertainty analysis, root mean square error (RMSE), percent of BIAS (PBIAS), Nash Sutcliff efficiency (NSE) and RMSE-observations standard deviation ratio (RSR)) techniques were used for model evaluation and comparison. Results of feature selection approaches revealed that DP, AT, SM, and ST are the four most effective variables at CO2 prediction in PEI, while AT, RH, DP, and ST are the most effective in the NB study area. For optimum input scenario, the GS algorithm was applied, and results showed that a combination of DP, AT, ST, SM, and ETo was the best for the PEI study area, while for NB, all input variables should be involved. Our analysis, for prediction of CO2 fluxes, confirmed that the ICO-AR-RF model performed the best at both PEI (RMSE=0.70, NSE=0.76, PBIAS=-5.11, RSR=0.48) and NB (RMSE=0.74, NSE=0.75, PBIAS=3.23, RSR=0.50), followed by MS-RF and AR-RF. Uncertainty analysis showed that CO2 prediction is more sensitive to input scenario selection than models in both study areas. Results revealed that climatic variables are more effective in CO2 prediction than soil characteristics and the developed hybrid model ICO-AR-RF can be a promising tool for decision-makers and beneficial for stakeholders. © 2024",Greenhouse gases; Hybrid models; Predictive analytics; Soil-climatic variables,,Yes,Yes,Not Specified,"climate & meteorology, vegetation indices, soil",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0

Despite the introduction of various methods for estimating ETc act values, these methods are still associated with several challenges and limitations. Motivated by the robustness of deep learning models, this study employed two hybrid models that integrate Convolution Neural Network with either Random Forests (CNN-RF) or Support Vector Machine (CNN-SVR) to estimate potato ETc act using a limited set of input features. Three models were configured and compared for each CNN-RF (CNN-RF1, CNNRF2, CNNRF3) and CNN-SVM (CNN-SVM1, CNN-SVM2, CNN-SVM3), by using different combinations of variable input features derived from meteorological data (air temperature (Ta), vapour pressure deficit (VPD), net radiation (Rn)) and MODIS satellite data (land surface temperature (LST), fraction of photosynthetically active radiation (Fpar), leaf area index (LAI)). The results demonstrated the outstanding performance of the CNN-RF models, showcasing their superiority over the CNN-SVM models. Notably CNN-RF1 model yielded the best results, achieving a normalized root mean squared error (nRMSE) of 11.7 and 31.5 %; Nash–Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) of 0.97 and 0.80; Correlation coefficient (CC) of 0.99 and 0.91 at training and testing phases respectively. While, both models exhibited lower performance when using remote sensing satellite-based inputs, CNN-RF2, managed to produce satisfactory estimates of nRMSE = 16.7, 40.9 %; NSE = 0.95, 0.66; CC = 0.98, 0.813; Bias = −0.41, −4.377 W/m2 during training and testing respectively. The ETc act of potato showed to have high correlation with LST (0.74–0.84) and using LST as proxy for Ta, resulted in improved model estimates compared to using satellite data exclusively. These findings suggest that, in situations where climatic data is limited, remote sensing can serve as a viable alternative for modelling potato ETc act when coupled with CNN-RF, and further improvement can be achieved by incorporating meteorological data fusion. © 2024",AmeriFlux; Crop water use; Limited inputs; Random Forests; Remote sensing,Convolutional neural networks; Deep neural networks; Support vector machines; Time difference of arrival; Waste treatment; AmeriFlux; Convolution neural network; Crop evapotranspiration; Crop water use; Input features; Land surface temperature; Limited input; Meteorological data; Random forests; Remote-sensing; correlation; estimation method; evapotranspiration; leaf area index; machine learning; MODIS; photosynthetically active radiation; potato; precision agriculture; remote sensing; satellite data; surface temperature; training; water use; Mean square error,Yes,Yes,"weather station, remote sensing","climate & meteorology, vegetation indices",0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0

To effectively improve the accuracy of ET0 simulated by machine learning models, five meteorological stations in Hailaer, Harbin, Hohhot, Changchun, and Dalian were taken as representative stations, daily and monthly ET0 data from 1952 to 2020 were used, and empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and wavelet threshold denoising (WD) were considered. The convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory network (LSTM) models were improved, and two new hybrid neural network models (EMD–WD–CNN and EMD–WD–LSTM) were constructed. Using the ET0 calculated using the FAO-56 Penman–Monteith (P–M) formula as the standard value, the applicability of the improved machine learning model was evaluated. Results showed the following: i) the daily ET0-PM minimum values of five stations were close to 0, the average values were not significantly increased, and the maximum values significantly fluctuated (the fluctuations in Hailaer and Hohhot showed an upward trend, and the fluctuations in Harbin, Changchun, and Dalian showed a downward trend). The annual average monthly ET0-PM varied seasonally, with the peak in June in the Hailaer station and May in all other stations (the peak in Hohhot was the largest, and the peak in Dalian was the smallest). ii) The daily and monthly ET0 values predicted by the proposed EMD–WD–CNN and EMD–WD–LSTM models were highly consistent with the calculated results of the P–M model, showing high accuracy on the daily and monthly ET0 of the simulated five stations (daily: mean absolute error (MAE), 0.30–0.41 mm/day; root mean square error (RMSE), 0.46–0.60 mm/day; R2, 0.86–0.95; monthly: MAE, 5.66–13.71 mm/month; RMSE, 8.97–18.04 mm/month; R2, 0.91–0.95). iii) The EMD–WD–CNN model was suitable for daily scale ET0 simulation and prediction in Northeast China and monthly scale in Harbin, Changchun, and Hohhot. The EMD–WD–LSTM model was suitable for monthly ET0 simulation and prediction in Hailaer and Dalian in Northeast China. The mixed models of EMD–WD–CNN and EMD–WD–CNN can effectively improve the prediction accuracy of ET0 and can provide a new method for agricultural development and irrigation regulation in Northeast China. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",Convolutional neural network; Hydro-informatics; Long short-term memory network; Prediction model; Reference crop evapotranspiration; Temporal and spatial scale,Changchun; China; Dalian; Harbin; Heilongjiang; Hohhot; Jilin; Liaoning; Nei Monggol; Associative storage; Long short-term memory; Prediction models; Time difference of arrival; Convolutional neural network; Empirical Mode Decomposition; Hydro-informatic; Informatics; Long short-term memory network; Memory network; Prediction modelling; Reference crop evapotranspirations; Short term memory; Temporal and spatial scale; agricultural development; artificial neural network; decomposition analysis; evapotranspiration; hydrological modeling; prediction; spatiotemporal analysis; water use; Convolutional neural networks,Yes,Yes,"weather station, empirical models","climate & meteorology, vegetation indices, plant physiology",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1
35,Wang L.; Zhang Y.,Filling GRACE data gap using an innovative transformer-based deep learning approach,2024,10.1016/j.rse.2024.114465,"The terrestrial water storage anomaly (TWSA), derived from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and its successor, the GRACE Follow-on (GRACE-FO) satellite, presents a remarkable opportunity for extreme weather detection and the enhancement of environmental protection. However, the practical utility of GRACE data is challenged by an 11-month data gap and several months of missing data. To address this limitation, we have developed an innovative transformer-based deep learning model for data gap-filling. This model incorporates a self-attention mechanism using causal convolution, allowing the neural network to capture the local context of GRACE time series data. It takes into account various factors such as temperature (T), precipitation (P), and evapotranspiration (ET). We trained the model using a global dataset of 10,000 time series pixels and applied it to fill all the time gaps. The validation results demonstrate its robustness, with an average root mean square error (RMSE) of 6.18 cm and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) of 0.906. Notably, the Transformer-based method outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches in arid regions. The incorporation of T, P, and ET has further enhanced the accuracy of gap filling, with an average RMSE decrease of 7.5 %. This study has produced a reliable gap-filling product that addresses 11-month data gaps and 24 isolated gaps, ensuring the continuity of GRACE data for various scholarly applications. Moreover, our Transformer approach holds important potential for surpassing traditional methods in predicting and filling gaps in remote sensing data and gridded observations. © 2024",Gap filling; GRACE; Terrestrial water storage anomaly; Transformer,Convolutional neural networks; Energy efficiency; Evapotranspiration; Extreme weather; Precipitation (meteorology); Time series; Tropics; Data gap; Experiment data; Extreme weather; Gap filling; Gravity recovery and climate experiments; Learning approach; Root mean square errors; Terrestrial water storage; Terrestrial water storage anomaly; Transformer; artificial neural network; data set; evapotranspiration; GRACE; machine learning; remote sensing; time series; water storage; Weather satellites,Yes,Yes,remote sensing,climate & meteorology,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

However, accurately calculating and measuring PET remains challenging due to the limited availability of comprehensive data. This study presents a detailed sustainable model for predicting PET using the Thornthwaite equation, which requires only mean monthly temperature (Tmean) and latitude, with calculations performed using R-Studio. A geographic information system (GIS) was employed to interpolate meteorological data, ensuring coverage of all sub-basins within the Murat River basin, the study area. Additionally, Python libraries were utilized to implement artificial intelligence-driven models, incorporating both machine learning and deep learning techniques. The study harnesses the power of artificial intelligence (AI), applying deep learning through a convolutional neural network (CNN) and machine learning techniques, including support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF). The results demonstrate promising performance across the models. For CNN, the coefficient of determination (R2) varied from 96.2 to 98.7%, the mean squared error (MSE) ranged from 0.287 to 0.408, and the root mean squared error (RMSE) was between 0.541 and 0.649. For SVM, the R2 varied from 94.5 to 95.6%, MSE ranged between 0.981 and 1.013, and RMSE ranged from 0.990 to 1.014. RF showed the best performance, achieving an R2 of 100%, MSE values of 0.326 and 0.640, and corresponding RMSE values of 0.571 and 0.800. The climate and topography data used for all algorithms were consistent, and the results indicate that the RF model outperforms the others. Consequently, The RF model’s superior accuracy highlights its potential as a reliable tool for sustainable PET prediction, supporting informed decision-making in water resource planning.

In this study, a hybrid modeling framework was constructed to enhance runoff prediction and water balance assessment in glacier basins. An improved physical hydrological model (SEGSWAT+) was combined with a machine learning model (ML) to capture the relationship between runoff residuals and water balance components through the Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) method. Based on the enhancement of the runoff fitting results of the existing model, the runoff residuals are decomposed and used to correct the hydrological process component values, thus improving the accuracy of the water balance results. We evaluated the performance and correction results of the method using various ML methods. We analyzed the results for two consecutive periods from 1959 to 2022 for the glacial sub-basins of three tributaries of the Upper Ili River Basin in central Asia. The results show that the hybrid framework based on extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) with an average NSE value of 0.93 has the best performance, and the bias based on the evapotranspiration component and soil water content change component is reduced by 3.2–5%, proving the effectiveness of the water balance correction.

However, conventional satellite-based approaches for LST retrieval often require additional data like land surface emissivity (LSE). Meanwhile, traditional machine learning (ML) techniques face challenges in acquiring representative training data and leveraging data from varied sources effectively. To address these issues, we introduce a novel transfer-learning (TL) neural network approach for LST retrieval using top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflective and emissive data from Landsat. This method not only improves LST retrieval by integrating various data types but also demonstrates the potential of shortwave data in surrogating LSE information, thereby reducing dependence on explicit LSE data. Our TL approach utilized extensive simulations from the radiative transfer model (RTM) and measurements from the real world. The simulations are comprehensive, covering a wide range of atmospheric and surface scenarios, and the inclusion of real-world data mitigates the discrepancy between simulations and actual observations. When applied to a decade of Landsat-8 observations and ground measurements from 241 stations across diverse regions, our TL method significantly outperforms ML, single-channel (SC), and split-window (SW) algorithms in terms of root mean square error (RMSE), with improvements of 0.46 K, 0.84 K, and 0.57 K, respectively. This superiority underscores the advantage of integrating simulated and observed data, as well as the benefit of utilizing both reflective and emissive data without relying on uncertain LSE inputs. Our findings present a promising new TL framework for estimating LST directly from TOA data, offering a robust approach that we have made publicly available through Google Earth Engine (GEE) for broader use.

In particular, food insecurity has emerged in Egypt due to climate change, population expansion, and rising food demand. Innovative techniques such as internet of things and machine learning are critical for farmers to make timely judgments that impact quality of agricultural harvests. A new open-source technology utilizing the Arduino Board was created to forecast the irrigation requirements of onion crops. The study implemented three different irrigation levels: 100%, 85%, and 70% of crop evapotranspiration (ETc) ML models, namely, Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Random Forest (RF), and Decision Tree (DT) models were constructed to predict onion yield based on meteorological and agronomic variables. These variables include minimum, and maximum temperatures, relative humidity, sun shine hour, solar radiation, growing degree days, vapor pressure deficit, plant height, leaf number per plant, readily available water. The results highlight that the highest onion yield values were recorded in 100% ETc (56.04 ton/ha), followed by 85% ETc (51.52 ton/ha). The lowest values were recorded at 70% ETc (43.36 ton/ha). The results also indicate that Arduino board optimize water usage by 13% and 28%, enhancing crop water productivity by 14.5 and 16 kg/m3 at 85% and 70% ETc, respectively. Additionally, the ANN model demonstrates a robust R2 value of 0.94 in predicting onion yield, while the RF and DT models perform at 0.90 and 0.86, respectively.

We describe the first global products (called X-BASE) from a newly implemented upscaling framework, FLUXCOM-X, representing an advancement from the previous generation of FLUXCOM products in terms of flexibility and technical capabilities. The X-BASE products are comprised of estimates of CO2 net ecosystem exchange (NEE), gross primary productivity (GPP), evapotranspiration (ET), and for the first time a novel, fully data-driven global transpiration product (ETT), at high spatial (0.05°) and temporal (hourly) resolution. X-BASE estimates the global NEE at −5.75 ± 0.33 Pg C yr−1 for the period 2001–2020, showing a much higher consistency with independent atmospheric carbon cycle constraints compared to the previous versions of FLUXCOM. The improvement of global NEE was likely only possible thanks to the international effort to increase the precision and consistency of eddy covariance collection and processing pipelines, as well as to the extension of the measurements to more site years resulting in a wider coverage of bioclimatic conditions. However, X-BASE global net ecosystem exchange shows a very low interannual variability, which is common to state-of-the-art data-driven flux products and remains a scientific challenge. With 125 ± 2.1 Pg C yr−1 for the same period, X-BASE GPP is slightly higher than previous FLUXCOM estimates, mostly in temperate and boreal areas. X-BASE evapotranspiration amounts to 74.7 × 103 ± 0.9×103 km3 globally for the years 2001–2020 but exceeds precipitation in many dry areas, likely indicating overestimation in these regions. On average 57 % of evapotranspiration is estimated to be transpiration, in good agreement with isotope-based approaches, but higher than estimates from many land surface models. Despite considerable improvements to the previous upscaling products, many further opportunities for development exist. Pathways of exploration include methodological choices in the selection and processing of eddy covariance and satellite observations, their ingestion into the framework, and the configuration of machine learning methods. For this, the new FLUXCOM-X framework was specifically designed to have the necessary flexibility to experiment, diagnose, and converge to more accurate global flux estimates. © Author(s) 2024.",,bioclimatology; carbon cycle; carbon dioxide; carbon flux; eddy covariance; evapotranspiration; land surface; machine learning; net ecosystem exchange; net primary production; water flux,Yes,Yes,"eddy covariance, remote sensing","climate & meteorology, vegetation indices",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0

[Objective] Vegetation cover is a critical indicator of ecosystem stability. Researches about the factors influencing vegetation cover changes in the ecologically sensitive Kunlun Mountains region are limited. This study aims to analyze the spatiotemporal variations of vegetation cover and their driving factors in the Kunlun Mountains and to perform a regional ecological assessment. [Methods] The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was used to examine the spatiotemporal patterns of vegetation cover from 2000 to 2020, and the Geodetector (GD) and Random Forest (RF) models were applied to identify the primary drivers of NDVI changes. Meanwhile, RF and Long Short−Term Memory Network (LSTM) models were used for predict the NDVI variations, and the Remote Sensing Ecological Index (RSEI) was used to evaluate environmental quality. [Results] NDVI showed a generally temporal increasing−decreasing−increasing trend, characterized by a spatial distribution that higher values in the west and north and lower values in the east and south. The RF model identified the digital elevation model (DEM), precipitation (Pre), distance to towns (Town), and gross domestic product (GDP) as the most influential factors, whereas the GD model showed evapotranspiration (ET), DEM, GDP, and temperature (Temp) had the greatest explanatory power. The RF model was more effective for NDVI regression analysis than the LSTM model in the study area. The RSEI value showed an increase in 80.52% of the area, but the overall variation was considerable, with 78.86% of the area showing significant variation. [Conclusions] DEM, GDP, Pre, and ET are the primary factors affecting vegetation cover in the region and the significant improvement in the regional ecosystem over the past two decades.

This research aims to develop a tomato yield (TY) estimation model using machine learning (ML) techniques, such as artificial neural networks (ANN), random forests (RF), and decision trees (DT), based on climate and plant variables. The climate variables include Growth Degree Days (GDD), Vapor Pressure Deficit (VPD), solar radiation, Total Sunshine Hours (N), Total Relative Humidity (TRH), and Reference Evapotranspiration (ETo). While plant variables include canopy water content (CWC), dry matter accumulation (DMA), N-sufficiency index (NSI), and Crop Evapotranspiration (ETc). Field experiments were conducted during 2022 and 2023 growing seasons, implementing three irrigation regimes: 100% (T100), 75% (T75), and 50% (T50) of the full irrigation requirements (FIR). The results showed that the highest TY was achieved at T100. In contrast, T75 resulted in a yield reduction of 25.85% and 28.42%, while T50 led to decreases of 54.74% and 55.76% compared to T100 during the first and second seasons, respectively. Also, ANOVA revealed no statistically significant differences in model performance. However, modest improvements in yield prediction accuracy can lead to substantial economic benefits for farmers. The RF model displayed even better accuracy, with an RMSE of 2.39-4.04 and 3.80-4.00 tons/ha, and an R² of 0.94-0.98 and 0.95 during the training and testing phases, respectively.

The results are as follows: (1) The correlation coefficients (r) between auxiliary data (such as sand fraction, r = −0.48; silt fraction, r = 0.47; and evapotranspiration, r = −0.42), SAR features (such as the backscatter coefficients for VV-pol ((Formula presented.)), r = 0.47), and optical RS features (such as Shortwave Infrared Band 2 (SWIR2) reflectance data from Sentinel-2 and Landsat-7/8/9, r = −0.39) with observed SM are significant. This indicates that multi-source data can provide complementary information for SM monitoring. (2) Compared to XGBoost and LSTM, RFR and EL demonstrate superior overall performance and are the preferred models for SM prediction. Their R2 for the training and test sets exceed 0.969 and 0.743, respectively, and their ubRMSE are below 0.022 and 0.063 m3/m3, respectively. (3) The SM prediction accuracy is highest for the scenario of optical + SAR + auxiliary data, followed by SAR + auxiliary data, and finally optical + auxiliary data. (4) With an increasing Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and SM values, the trained models exhibit a general decrease in prediction performance and accuracy. (5) In 2021 and 2022, without considering cloud cover, the IF theoretically achieved an SM revisit time of 1–3 days across 95.01% and 96.53% of China’s area, respectively. However, SC1 was able to achieve a revisit time of 1–3 days over 60.73% of China’s area in 2021 and 69.36% in 2022, while the area covered by SC2 and SC3 at this revisit time accounted for less than 1% of China’s total area. This study validates the effectiveness of combining multi-source RS data with auxiliary data in large-scale SM monitoring and provides new methods for improving SM retrieval accuracy and spatiotemporal coverage. © 2024 by the authors.",China; deep learning; high spatiotemporal resolution; machine learning; remote sensing; surface soil moisture,China; Landsat; machine learning; remote sensing; Sentinel; soil moisture; spatiotemporal analysis; synthetic aperture radar,Yes,Yes,remote sensing,"climate & meteorology, vegetation indices, soil",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0

Traditional models suffer from low accuracy in predicting transpiration stream concentration factor (TSCF) and root concentration factor (RCF). This study applied deep neural networks (DNN), recurrent neural networks (RNN), and long short-term memory (LSTM) to enhance the accuracy of predictive models for TSCF and RCF. The three models used nine chemical properties and two plant root macromolecular compositions for predicting TSCF and RCF. The results indicated that deep learning models predict TSCF and RCF with improved accuracy compared to mechanistic models. The coefficient of determination (R2) for the DNN, RNN, and LSTM models in predicting TSCF was 0.62, 0.67, and 0.56, respectively. The corresponding mean squared error (MSE) on the test set for the models was 0.055, 0.035, and 0.060, respectively.

Traditional methods for predicting ET0 require a variety of meteorological parameters. However, obtaining data for these multiple parameters can be challenging, leading to inaccuracies or inability to predict ET0 using traditional methods. This affects decision-making in critical applications such as agricultural irrigation scheduling and water management, consequently impacting the development of agricultural ecosystems. This issue is particularly pronounced in economically underdeveloped regions. Therefore, this paper proposes a machine learning-based evapotranspiration estimation method adapted to evapotranspiration conditions. Compared to traditional methods, our approach relies less on the variety of meteorological parameters and yields higher prediction accuracy. Additionally, we introduce a ‘region of evapotranspiration adaptability’ division method, which takes into account geographical differences in ET0 prediction. This effectively mitigates the negative impact of anomalies or missing data from individual meteorological stations, making our method more suitable for practical agricultural irrigation and ecosystem water resource management. We validated our approach using meteorological data from 25 stations in Heilongjiang, China. Our results indicate that non-adjacent geographical areas, despite different climatic conditions, can have similar impacts on ET0 prediction. In summary, our method facilitates accurate ET0 prediction, offering new insights for the development of agricultural irrigation and ecosystems, and further contributes to agricultural food supply. © The Author(s) under exclusive licence to International Society of Biometeorology 2024.",CatBoost; Evapotranspiration; Machine learning; Random Forest; XGBoost,Agricultural Irrigation; China; Machine Learning; Plant Transpiration; China; evapotranspiration; irrigation (agriculture); machine learning; procedures,Yes,Yes,weather station,climate & meteorology,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

In this study, ETo changes were projected for two future time slices with respect to the baseline using several machine learning techniques, incorporating minimum and maximum temperature, diurnal temperature range, and extraterrestrial radiation across Iran. Additionally, an ensemble of 10 CMIP6 Global Climate Models, downscaled by the NASA Earth Exchange Global Daily Downscaled Projections (NEX-GDDP-CMIP6), was employed. The X-means clustering algorithm was also exploited to classify ETo based on various characteristics, including minimum, maximum, average, skewness, and standard deviation, as well as ETo ranges of 0–5, 5–10, and greater than 10 mm d⁻¹. This clustering approach divided the study area into five distinct clusters. Apart from cluster I, where the Support Vector Machine outperformed, the Random Forest technique provided more accurate ETo predictions. The findings project an average ETo increase of 4.8 % and 5.3 % during 2030–2049, and 8.0 % and 13.3 % for 2080–2099 under SSP245 and SSP585, respectively. Geographically, the highest ETo increases are anticipated primarily in the northern and western parts of the country, predominantly within clusters I and II. Notably, the ETo rise will exceed 40 % relative to the baseline during the late century under the SSP585. Furthermore, the most significant ETo increment is expected during winter. Future projections also indicate that cluster V, which already experiences significant daily ETo peaks, will face even more ETo extremes. Given the critical importance of these regions for sustaining food and water security and preserving natural resources, the substantial rise in ETo under future CC poses a significant threat to natural sustainability in Iran. This highlights the critical necessity for adaptive strategies in agricultural water management to mitigate the adverse CC effects. In this context, the current findings can assist decision-makers in identifying hotspots and quantifying CC impacts, thereby enabling the design of crucial adaptations. © 2024 The Authors",Adaptation; Clustering; Ensembling; ET<sub>o</sub> extremes; ML-GCM; Random forest,Iran; Adversarial machine learning; Deforestation; Evapotranspiration; Random forests; Support vector machines; Tropics; Water management; Adaptation; Agricultural water management; Clusterings; Ensembling; Evapotranspiration extreme; Food security; ML-GCM; Multi-model ensemble; Random forests; Water security; algorithm; climate change; evapotranspiration; local adaptation; machine learning; sustainability; water management; Decision making,Yes,Yes,Not Specified,"climate & meteorology, vegetation indices",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0

Accurate estimation of the GPP and in-depth exploration of its response mechanisms to drought are essential for understanding ecosystem stability and developing strategies for climate change adaptation. Combining remote sensing technology and machine learning is currently the mainstream method for estimating the GPP in terrestrial ecosystems, which can eliminate the uncertainty of model parameters and errors in input data. This study employed extreme gradient boosting, random forest (RF), and light use efficiency models. Additionally, we integrated solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF), near-infrared reflectance of vegetation, and the leaf area index (LAI) to construct various GPP estimation models. The standardised precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) was utilised at various timescales to analyse the relationship between the GPP and SPEI during dry years. Moreover, the potential pathways and coefficients of environmental factors that influence GPP were explored using structural equation modelling. Our key findings include the following: (1) the model combining the SIF and RF algorithms exhibits higher accuracy and applicability in estimating vegetation GPP in the arid zone of Xinjiang, with an overall accuracy (MODIS R2) of 0.775; (2) the vegetation in Xinjiang had different response characteristics to different timescales of drought, in which the optimal timescale for GPP to respond to drought was 9 months, with a mean correlation coefficient of 0.244 between grass land GPP and SPEI09, indicating high sensitivity; (3) using structural equation modelling, we found that temperature and precipitation can affect GPP both directly and indirectly through LAI. This study provides a reliable tool for estimating the GPP in Xinjiang, and its methodology and conclusions are important references for similar environments. In addition, this study bridges the research gap in drought response to GPP at different timescales, and the potential influence mechanism of natural factors on GPP provides a scientific basis for early warning of drought and ecosystem management. Further validation using a longer time series is required to confirm the robustness of the model. © 2024 by the authors.",drought; GPP; machine learning; SIF; SPEI; structural equation modelling; Xinjiang arid zone,Accuracy; Drought; Ecosystems; Estimation; Fluorescence; Plants; Precipitation; Evapotranspiration; Arid zones; Chlorophyll fluorescence; Gross primary production; Machine-learning; Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence; Standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index; Structural equation models; Time-scales; Xinjiang; Xinjiang arid zone; drought; environmental factor; human activity; leaf area index; machine learning; remote sensing; terrestrial ecosystem; vegetation; Vegetation,Yes,Yes,remote sensing,"climate & meteorology, vegetation indices",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0

For example, rising temperatures could result in increased evapotranspiration demand, causing difficulties in the management of irrigation practices. Generally, an important predictor of plant water status to be taken into account for irrigation monitoring and management is the stem water potential. However, it requires a huge amount of time-consuming fieldwork, particularly when an adequate data amount is necessary to fully investigate the spatial and temporal variability of large areas under monitoring. In this study, the integration of machine learning and satellite remote sensing (Sentinel-2) was investigated to obtain a model able to predict the stem water potential in viticulture using multispectral imagery. Vine water status data were acquired within a Montepulciano vineyard in the south of Italy (Puglia region), under semi-arid conditions; data were acquired over two years during the irrigation seasons. Different machine learning algorithms (lasso, ridge, elastic net, and random forest) were compared using vegetation indices and spectral bands as predictors in two independent analyses. The results show that it is possible to remotely estimate vine water status with random forest from vegetation indices (R2 = 0.72).

This research aims to identify the optimal machine learning model for predicting the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), utilizing ETo, LST, and precipitation as input parameters. Assessing from 2002 to 2022, the study investigates the relationships between NDVI, LST, ETo, and precipitation in Delhi. Monthly precipitation data was sourced from the Center for Hydrometeorology and Remote Sensing (CHRS) portal, while LST and NDVI were derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products using Google Earth Engine (GEE). Four distinct machine learning models – random forest algorithm (RF), support vector regression (SVR), K-nearest neighbours (KNN) technique, and gradient boosting machine (GBM) model – were employed for NDVI prediction. Performance assessment metrics, including coefficient of determination (R2), root mean square error (RMSE), mean square error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and explained variance score (EVS), was calculated to evaluate model effectiveness. The analysis of R2 and RMSE values across different districts in Delhi using the testing dataset revealed the random forest (RF) model as consistently robust. High R2 values and low RMSE values underscore the RF model’s reliability in predicting variables, making it a favourable choice for the complex spatial dynamics within Delhi. A Pearson correlation (r) matrix heatmap was generated that visually represents the relationships among environmental variables – ETo, LST, precipitation, and NDVI. The analysis reveals a strong positive correlation between actual evapotranspiration (ETo) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), indicating increased vegetation density with higher ETo. Conversely, land surface temperature (LST) exhibits a weak negative correlation with ETo and a mild positive correlation with precipitation.

ETO significantly impacts the water balance and holds great importance at the basin level because of the spatial distribution of managing water resources. Large scale teleconnection indices (LSTIs) play a vital role by influencing climatic variables and can be pivotal in determining ETO and its predictive variables. This study aimed to model and forecast annual ETO in Iran’s basins by utilizing LSTIs and employing various machine learning models (MLMs) such as least squares support vector machine, generalized regression neural network, multi-linear regression (MLR), and multi-layer perceptron (MLP). Initially, climate data from 122 synoptic stations covering six and 30, main and sub basins were collected, and annual ETO values were computed using the Food and Agriculture Organization 56 (PMF 56) Penman–Monteith equation. The correlations between these values and 37 LSTIs were examined within lead times ranging from 7 to 12 months. Through a stepwise approach, the most influential predictor indices (LSTIs) were selected as input datasets for the MLMs. The findings revealed the significant influence of factors such as carbon dioxide (CO2), Atlantic multidecadal oscillation, Atlantic Meridional Mode, and East Atlantic on annual ETO. Overall, all MLMs performed well in terms of the Scatter Index during both training and testing phases across all sub-basins.

The techniques of forecasting ET0 have progressed from empirical equations to artificial intelligence-based models. However, gaps have remained in comprehensively evaluating the ET0 forecast performance discrepancies between various methods based on weather forecasts in addition to historical meteorological data, as well as investigating the effect of the amount of input variables on ET0 forecast accuracy. Here, the study evaluated the forecast accuracy of five conventional equations calibrated and six machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models in predicting daily ET0 for a lead time of 1–7 days in the North China Plain (NCP). Comparative evaluations indicate that the Analytical Penman-Monteith (APM) is the optimum empirical equation for forecasting ET0, but its accuracy decreases as lead times increase. Conversely, ML and DL models consistently outperform empirical equations, characterized by lower mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE) as well as correlation coefficient and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient approaching 1 across all lead times. Notably, the Bidirectional Long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) model outperforms other models, maintaining robust and effective forecast performance even on day 7. Moreover, with the increasing input variables, combining weather forecasts and historical meteorological data, the forecast performance of all models is improved, with significant enhancement observed in the Bi-LSTM model.

The objectives of this study were to 1) simulate daily ETc and SMC of green beans and sweet corn under full irrigation and three deficit irrigation rates using the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) CROPGRO-Green bean and CERES–Sweet corn models and 2) evaluate the performance of three machine learning models for simulating ETc of green beans and sweet corn. The DSSAT models were calibrated using measured phenological, biomass, and yield data collected during two years of experiments at the University of Florida, Tropical Research and Education Center (TREC) during the winter (dry) seasons of 2020–21 and 2021–22. The experiments were conducted under four irrigation treatments: 100% full irrigation (FI), 75% FI, 50% FI, and 25% FI, with four replications. The simulated daily ETc and SMC under each irrigation treatment were compared with estimated ETc based on changes in SMC and measured SMC, respectively. Estimating ETc based on changes in SMC involved quantifying sub-hourly moisture loss during the drying phase of soil and aggregating the results into daily timesteps. The eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), light gradient-boosting machine (LightGBM), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) models were trained using SMC and weather variables to simulate daily ETc of green beans and sweet corn. The results showed that the CROPGRO and CERES models could reasonably simulate SMC dynamics of green beans and sweet corn plots. The models simulated SMC better for the three deficit irrigation treatments than the full irrigation treatment. The CROPGRO model evaluation index of agreement (d-Stat) and mean absolute error (MAE) for 25% FI treatment were 0.72 and 0.03 cm3 cm−3, and 0.75 and 0.03 cm3 cm−3 for the CERES model. However, the DSSAT models did not perform well in simulating ETc for green beans and sweet corn. Average d-Stat and MAE for the CROPGRO during model evaluation were 0.5- and 1.0-mm day−1 and 0.6- and 1.1-mm day−1 for CERES, respectively. The performance of all machine learning (ML) models for simulating daily ETc of green beans and sweet corn was better than the CROPGRO and CERES models. Incorporating machine learning algorithms into the DSSAT model has the potential to enhance its performance in simulating ETc. Overall, the results suggest that DSSAT and ML models could potentially be used as alternative decision support tools for assessing and managing irrigation strategies and optimizing water use efficiency under different management and environmental conditions. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",Crop water requirement; DSSAT; Gradient boosting; Simulation; Support vector machine; Variable rate irrigation,Florida [United States]; United States; Adaptive boosting; Agricultural technology; Crops; Decision support systems; Efficiency; Irrigation; Learning systems; Soil moisture; Water supply; Agrotechnology transfer; Crop water requirements; Decision support system for agrotechnology transfer; Gradient boosting; Green beans; Simulation; Soil moisture content; Support vectors machine; Sweet corns; Variable rate irrigations; crop yield; evapotranspiration; growth rate; irrigation system; moisture content; soil moisture; support vector machine; water use; water use efficiency; Support vector machines,Yes,Yes,Not Specified,"climate & meteorology, vegetation indices, soil, plant physiology",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1

Traditional identification methods necessitate laborious on-site observation and measurement, consuming time and effort. Leveraging unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing technology to forecast photosynthetic indices opens up the potential for swiftly discerning high-photosynthetic-efficiency wheat varieties. The objective of this research is to develop a multi-stage predictive model encompassing nine photosynthetic indicators at the field scale for wheat breeding. These indices include soil and plant analyzer development (SPAD), leaf area index (LAI), net photosynthetic rate (Pn), transpiration rate (Tr), intercellular CO2 concentration (Ci), stomatal conductance (Gsw), photochemical quantum efficiency (PhiPS2), PSII reaction center excitation energy capture efficiency (Fv’/Fm’), and photochemical quenching coefficient (qP). The ultimate goal is to differentiate high-photosynthetic-efficiency wheat varieties through model-based predictions. This research gathered red, green, and blue spectrum (RGB) and multispectral (MS) images of eleven wheat varieties at the stages of jointing, heading, flowering, and filling. Vegetation indices (VIs) and texture features (TFs) were extracted as input variables. Three machine learning regression models (Support Vector Machine Regression (SVR), Random Forest (RF), and BP Neural Network (BPNN)) were employed to construct predictive models for nine photosynthetic indices across multiple growth stages. Furthermore, the research conducted principal component analysis (PCA) and membership function analysis on the predicted values of the optimal models for each indicator, established a comprehensive evaluation index for high photosynthetic efficiency, and employed cluster analysis to screen the test materials. The cluster analysis categorized the eleven varieties into three groups, with SH06144 and Yannong 188 demonstrating higher photosynthetic efficiency. The moderately efficient group comprises Liangxing 19, SH05604, SH06085, Chaomai 777, SH05292, Jimai 22, and Guigu 820, totaling seven varieties. Xinmai 916 and Jinong 114 fall into the category of lower photosynthetic efficiency, aligning closely with the results of the clustering analysis based on actual measurements. The findings suggest that employing UAV-based multi-source remote sensing technology to identify wheat varieties with high photosynthetic efficiency is feasible.

To address this issue, we developed a hybrid model called HSTIC by integrating a machine learning (ML) model for estimating surface relative humidity (RH0) into the analytically-driven Surface Temperature Initiated Closure (STIC) model, which is based on thermal remote sensing. The ML-RH0 model utilizes the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) algorithm and was trained with meteorological and multispectral and thermal infrared remote sensing data. This hybrid approach combines the strengths of ML in estimating RH0 with the analytical framework of STIC. Evaluations were conducted based on observed meteorological factors and heat fluxes from 200 flux sites in the FLUXNET2015 dataset, alongside MODIS remote sensing data. The results demonstrated that including the ML-RH0 significantly improved the accuracy of estimating surface water stress variations. HSTIC performed well in reproducing latent and sensible heat fluxes (λE and H). Under experimental conditions, utilizing tower-retrieved land surface temperature (TR), HSTIC demonstrated a coefficient of determination (R2) ranging from 0.76 to 0.90 and root mean square deviation (RMSD) between 35 and 48 Wm−2 for estimating (half-)hourly λE and H. In practical scenarios using MODIS TR, HSTIC exhibited an R2 of 0.60 to 0.68 and an RMSD of 21 to 26 Wm−2 for daily λE and H when upscaled from instantaneous retrievals at satellite overpass time. Notably, HSTIC surpassed the analytical STIC model, particularly under dry conditions. This improvement is attributed to the more accurate simulation of canopy-surface conductance (gSurf) and its responses to water stress. The enhanced representation of gSurf in HSTIC effectively captures variations in physiological traits across global ecosystems, reflecting how plants adapt to seasonal temperature changes. Our findings suggest that HSTIC provides a fresh perspective for process-based models in simulating terrestrial evapotranspiration. By accurately capturing the dynamic interactions between surface and atmospheric conditions, HSTIC offers a robust tool for understanding and predicting ET under varying environmental conditions. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.",Evapotranspiration; Land surface temperature; Machine learning; Surface conductance; Surface energy balance; Water stress,Atmospheric temperature; Energy balance; Land surface temperature; Machine learning; Plant shutdowns; Radiometers; Remote sensing; Surface measurement; Surface temperature; Surface waters; Closure models; Land surface temperature; Machine-learning; Remote sensing data; Root-mean-square deviations; Surface conductance; Surface energy balance; Surface temperatures; Terrestrial evapotranspiration; Water stress; algorithm; analytical framework; evapotranspiration; humidity; land surface; machine learning; MODIS; relative humidity; satellite; surface temperature; water stress; Evapotranspiration,Yes,Yes,"weather station, remote sensing","climate & meteorology, vegetation indices, plant physiology",0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1

Similarly, global soil selenium (Se) concentrations were predicted to drop, particularly in Europe, due to increases in leaching attributed to increases in aridity. Given its international importance in agriculture, reductions of essential elements, including S and Se, in European soils could have important impacts on nutrition and human health. Our objectives were to model current soil S and Se levels in Europe and predict concentration changes for the 21st century. We interrogated four machine-learning (ML) techniques, but after critical evaluation, only outputs for linear support vector regression (Lin-SVR) models for S and Se and the multilayer perceptron model (MLP) for Se were consistent with known mechanisms reported in literature. Other models exhibited overfitting even when differences in training and testing performance were low or non-existent. Furthermore, our results highlight that similarly performing models based on RMSE or R2 can lead to drastically different predictions and conclusions, thus highlighting the need to interrogate machine learning models and to ensure they are consistent with known mechanisms reported in the literature. Both elements exhibited similar spatial patterns with predicted gains in Scandinavia versus losses in the central and Mediterranean regions of Europe, respectively, by the end of the 21st century for an extreme climate scenario. The median change was −5.5% for S (Lin-SVR) and −3.5% (MLP) and −4.0% (Lin-SVR) for Se. For both elements, modeled losses were driven by decreases in soil organic carbon, S and Se atmospheric deposition, and gains were driven by increases in evapotranspiration. © 2024 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Environmental Monitoring; Europe; Machine Learning; Models, Chemical; Selenium; Soil; Soil Pollutants; Sulfur; Atmospheric chemistry; Deposition; Machine learning; Meteorological problems; Organic carbon; Selenium; Sulfur; organic carbon; selenium; sulfur; selenium; sulfur; % reductions; 'current; Atmospheric depositions; Concentration change; Essential elements; Human health; Machine-learning; Multilayers perceptrons; Selenium concentrations; Support vector regressions; agricultural worker; Article; atmospheric deposition; climate; climate change; Europe; evapotranspiration; food quantity; geology; human impact (environment); machine learning; multilayer perceptron; precipitation; prediction; soil; soil acidity; soil fertility; soil property; Southern Europe; support vector machine; vegetation; chemical model; chemistry; environmental monitoring; Europe; procedures; soil pollutant; Soils",Yes,Yes,Not Specified,climate & meteorology,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Land Surface Models (LSMs) typically represent vegetation characteristics by monthly climatological indices. However, static vegetation parameterization does not fully capture time-varying vegetation characteristics, such as responses to climatic fluctuations, long-term trends, and interannual variability. It remains unclear how the interaction between vegetation and climate variability propagates into hydrologic fluxes and water resources. Multi-source satellite data sets may introduce uncertainties and require extensive time for analysis. This study developes a deep learning surrogate for a widely used LSM (i.e., Noah) as a rapid diagnosic tool. The calibrated surrogate quantifies the impacts of time-varying vegetation characteristics from multiple remotely sensed GVF products on the magnitude, seasonality, and biotic and abiotic components of hydrologic fluxes. Using the Upper Colorado River Basin (UCRB) as a test case, we found that time-varying vegetation provides more buffering effect against climate fluctuation than the static vegetation configuration, leading to reduced variability in the abiotic evaporation components (e.g., soil evaporation). In addition, time-varying vegetation from multi-source remote sensing products consistently predicts smaller biotic evaporation components (e.g., transpiration), leading to increased water yield in the UCRB (about 14%) compared to the static vegetation scheme. We also highlight the interaction between dynamic vegetation parameterization and static parameterization (e.g., soil) during calibration. Parameter recalibration and a re-evaluation of certain model assumptions may be required for assessing climate change impacts on vegetation and basin-wide water resources. © 2024.

Efficient dam management can mitigate negative impacts and enhance benefits such as flood and drought reduction, energy efficiency, water access, and improved irrigation. This study tackles the critical issue of predicting dam occupancy levels precisely to contribute to sustainable water management by enabling efficient water allocation among sectors, proactive drought management, controlled flood risk mitigation, and preservation of downstream ecological integrity. Our research suggests that combining physical models of water inflow and outflow “such as evapotranspiration using the Penman–Monteith equation, along with parameters like water consumption, solar radiation, and rainfall” with data-driven models based on historical reservoir data is crucial for accurately predicting occupancy levels. We implemented various prediction models, including Random Forest, Extra Trees, Long Short-Term Memory, Orthogonal Matching Pursuit CV, and Lasso Lars CV. To strengthen our proposed model with robust evidence, we conducted statistical tests on the mean absolute percentage errors of the models. Consequently, we demonstrated the impact of physical model parameters on prediction performance and identified the best method for predicting dam occupancy levels by comparing it with findings from the scientific literature. © 2024 by the authors.",artificial intelligence; dam occupancy level prediction; integrated water resource management,artificial intelligence; drought; error analysis; evapotranspiration; historical record; prediction; resource allocation; water management; water use,Yes,Yes,empirical models,"climate & meteorology, vegetation indices",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0

The predictors include the current and past land surface conditions and dynamical model hindcasts from the Subseasonal to Seasonal Prediction project (S2S). When the methods are enhanced with machine learning and other improvements, the increases in skill are almost exclusively coming from predictors drawn from observations of current and past land surface states. This suggests that operational S2S flash drought forecasts should focus on optimizing use of information on current conditions rather than on integrating dynamically based forecasts, given the current state of knowledge. Nonlinear machine learning methods lead to improved skill over linear methods for soil moisture but not for ESI. Improvements for both soil moisture and ESI are realized by increasing the sample size by including surrounding grid points in training and increasing the number of predictors. In addition, all the improvements in the soil moisture forecasts predominantly impact soil moistening rather than soil drying-i.e., prediction of conditions moving away from drought rather than into drought-especially when the initial soil state is drier than normal.

To develop the index, different combinations of the temperature condition index, precipitation condition index, vegetation condition index, soil moisture condition index, gross primary productivity, and normalized difference water index were used to obtain a single drought severity index. To obtain more effective results, a mesoscale hydrologic model was used to obtain soil moisture values. The SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) algorithm was used to calculate the weights for the combined index. To provide input to the SHAP model, crop yield was predicted using a machine learning model, with the training set yielding a correlation coefficient (R) of 0.8, while the test set values were calculated to be 0.68. The representativeness of the new index in drought situations was compared with established indices, including the Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) and the Self-Calibrated Palmer Drought Severity Index (scPDSI). The index showed the highest correlation with an R-value of 0.82, followed by the SPEI with 0.7 and scPDSI with 0.48.

The Ecosystem Services Value (ESV) is an indicator used to quantifying ecosystem services. Accurately estimating the dynamics of ESV and the threshold effects of influencing factors is of great importance for the sustainable development of the region. This study constructs an ESV valuation model based on the equivalent factor method, incorporating construction land, and corrects the initial valuation results in three dimensions. By constructing a random forest model and integrating partial dependence analysis, Elevation, Evapotranspiration, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, and the proportion of built-up land area were identified as significant factors in determining ecologically vulnerable areas within the study region. The results show that: (1) The total ESV in Henan along the Yellow River in 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2020 was 204.612 billion yuan, 249.775 billion yuan, 239.100 billion yuan, 234.868 billion yuan and 202.767 billion yuan, respectively. The overall trend of change is first growth and then decline, with spatial features remaining relatively stable, and ESV polarization becoming more pronounced. (2) The spatial clustering characteristics of ESV in Henan along the Yellow River are remarkable, and the cold and hot spot areas show a bidirectional expansion trend. The cold spot areas expand substantially around the construction land, whilethe hot spot areas show a small expansion around the western mountain areas and the vegetation areas along the Yellow River, but the overall growth is slower. (3) The main factors affecting ESV include three natural factors and one anthropogenic factor, namely evapotranspiration (ET), the proportion of built-up land area (POB), normalized vegetation index (NDVI) and elevation (ELEV). ESV is at a high level when ELEV>718 m, ET<90 mm, NDVI>0.7, and POB<25.67 % approximately.

Data-driven models exhibit strong predictive ET capabilities, yet significant limitations like naive extrapolation hamper wider generalization. In this perspective, we explore a novel hybrid deep learning (DL) framework to integrate domain knowledge and demonstrate its potential for evaluating ET under the influence of soil salinity. Specifically, we integrated physical constraints from process models (Penman-Monteith or Shuttleworth-Wallace) and salinity-induced stomatal stress mechanisms into the DL algorithm, and evaluated its performance by comparing four diverse scenarios. Results demonstrate that hybrid DL framework offers a promising alternative for ET estimation, achieving comparable accuracy to pure DL during training and validation. Nonetheless, due to the limited available measurements, data-driven model may not adequately capture plant responses to salt stress, leading to significant prediction biases observed during independent testing. Encouragingly, the hybrid DL model (DL-SS) integrating Shuttleworth-Wallace and salinity-induced stomatal stress mechanisms demonstrated enhanced interpretability, generalizability, and extrapolation capabilities. During testing, DL-SS consistently showed optimal performance, yielding root mean square error (RMSE) values of 37.4 W m−2 for sunflower and 39.2 W m−2 for maize. Compared to traditional Jarvis-type approaches (JPM and JSW) and pure DL model during testing, DL-SS achieved substantial reductions in RMSE values: 51%, 33%, and 43% for sunflower, and 45%, 31%, and 35% for maize, respectively. These findings highlight the importance of integrating prior scientific knowledge into data-driven models to enhance extrapolation capability of ET modeling, especially in salinized regions where conventional models may struggle. © 2024.

While various methods have been proposed to obtain accurate ET0, the conventional approach is complex, uneconomical, and unable to contend with the rising variability and unpredictable weather patterns. Meanwhile, the lack of meteorological data limits the accurate estimation of ET0 via empirical models. Considering the recent approach in coupling ML techniques with optimisation algorithms to enhance the accuracy and robustness of ET0 estimation, this study was conducted to explore the performance of optimised hybrid Support Vector Regression (SVR) models integrated with meta-heuristic algorithms for daily ET0 estimation in Malaysia. Four hybrid SVR models, including SVR-Particle Swarm Optimisation (SVR-PSO), SVR-Whale Optimisation Algorithm (SVR-WOA), SVR-Differential Evolution (SVR-DE), and SVR-Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (SVR-CMAES), were developed and assessed using the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), coefficient of determination (R2), and Global Performance Index (GPI). The accuracy of the hybrid SVR models was then compared against standalone Machine Learning (ML) and empirical models using limited meteorological data. Accordingly, the findings highlighted the superior accuracy of the SVR-PSO model in estimating ET0, followed closely by the SVR-DE and SVR-CMAES models. The outstanding performance of the SVR-PSO model was attributed to the inherent versatility and robustness of PSO, as well as its core social behaviour and swarm intelligence principles that allow for an exhaustive exploration of the solution space, thus enhancing the model's accuracy and reliability. In conclusion, the integration of SVR with the meta-heuristics algorithm represents a significant advancement in ET0 estimation models with enhanced accuracy. The study underlines the critical role of advanced hybrid models in enhancing ET0 prediction accuracy, thereby supporting the implementation of efficient water resource management and strategic planning across Malaysia. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.",Machine learning; Metaheuristics algorithm; Optimization; Reference evapotranspiration estimation; Support vector regression,Covariance matrix; Evapotranspiration; Heuristic algorithms; Mean square error; Meteorology; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Regression analysis; Water management; Accurate estimation; Hybrid support; Machine-learning; Meta-heuristics algorithms; Meteorological data; Optimisations; Reference evapotranspiration; Reference evapotranspiration estimation; Support vector regression models; Support vector regressions; algorithm; estimation method; evapotranspiration; heuristics; regression analysis; support vector machine; Machine learning,Yes,Yes,weather station,climate & meteorology,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

This study investigated the application of multidimensional forecast of precipitation and potential evapotranspiration at the Paranapanema River Basin (PRB) for the years 2023–2025. PRB is a region that provides hydrological, energy and agricultural resources, located in the southeast of Brazil that has suffered several problems related to water deficit and stress as well as droughts in the last 10 years. For these reasons, geospatial technologies such as remote sensing and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) were applied to generate time series between 2001 and early 2023 for a total of 22 Hydrological Planning Units (HPUs) in the PRB. Subsequently, a Neural Network Auto Regression (NNAR) was used to forecast precipitation and potential evapotranspiration of the HPUs in the period 2023–2025, finding for the months of May, June, July and August of 2024 and later in 2025 possible periods of water deficit in the central and northern regions. Finally, a comparative analysis of possible impacts on the agricultural, energy and social sectors based on the forecast developed by the NNAR network is presented, showing possible scenarios for short and mid-term water planning in the PRB. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",Drought; GIS; Hydrological cycle; Machine learning; Remote sensing,Brazil; Brazil; Paranapanema River; artificial neural network; climate change; climate effect; drought; extreme event; forecasting method; GIS; hydrological cycle; machine learning; potential evapotranspiration; precipitation (climatology); remote sensing; time series; water planning; water resource,Yes,Yes,remote sensing,"climate & meteorology, vegetation indices",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0

When there is a lack of direct measurements, the soil water potential values must be deduced from soil water content dynamics that can be monitored at the plot scale or obtained at a larger scale from remote sensing information. Because the relationship between water content and soil water potential in natural field soils is highly ambiguous, the prediction of soil water potential from water content data is a big challenge. The hysteretic relationship observed in nine soil profiles in the region of Solothurn (Switzerland) is not a simple function of texture or wetting–drainage cycles but depends on seasonal patterns that may be related to soil structural dynamics. Because the physical mechanisms governing seasonal hysteresis are unclear, we developed a deep neural network model that predicts water potential changes using rainfall, potential evapotranspiration, and water content time series as inputs. To adapt the model for multiple locations, we incorporated a deep autoencoder neural network as a classifier. The autoencoder compresses the water content time series into a site-specific feature that is highly representative of the underlying water content dynamics of each site and quantifies the similarity of dynamic patterns. By adding the autoencoder’s output as an additional input and training the neural network model with three stations located in three major classes established by the autoencoder, we predict matric potential for other sites. This method has the potential to deduce the dynamics of matric potential from water content data (including satellite data) despite strong seasonal effects that cannot be captured by standard methods. © Author(s) 2024.

Existing machine learning research often lacks detailed explanations, leading to generalized predictions without considering essential driving factors necessary for yielding an insightful understanding of glacier melting dynamics. To overcome these limitations and fulfill multi-level analysis requirements for comprehending glacier melting, this study identifies factors contributing to glacier melting heterogeneity and assesses distinct melting causes in three spatial melted glacier clusters. We utilized K-means unsupervised classification to cluster Tibet melted glaciers into three categories based on temperature, sunshine hours, evapotranspiration, precipitation, normalized vegetation index, and slope. XGBoost algorithm explores the nonlinear relationships of glacier melting with these features and Shapley values were used for model transparency, quantifying feature's influence on the melting process. Investigating geographical heterogeneity among clusters enhanced our understanding of the observed changes. High fitting accuracy (>0.98) enhanced the result reliability, as well.

However, these two areas of research often work independently, producing valuable studies, but without an effective integration to predict actual evapotranspiration directly, without the need for weather stations. Thus, this study aimed to model actual evapotranspiration in sugarcane crop using machine learning techniques, independently of weather stations and thermal sensor data.

An accurate and precise estimation and prediction of reference evapotranspiration (ETo) is necessary for regional management of water resources and irrigation scheduling. The challenge of predicting daily evapotranspiration with limited meteorological data in Bangladesh. This study aims to predict daily evapotranspiration using limited meteorological data of Bangladesh by three deep learning (CNN, GRU, LSTM) and one hybrid (CNN-GRU) model. The novel method of hybrid CNN-GRU models, which have not been commonly used for this purpose. The performance of models was evaluated by five accuracy matrices R2, RMSE, MAE, MAPE, and CE and comparison is visualized by radar graphs. The study’s novelty lies in the use of hybrid CNN-GRU models to estimate reference evapotranspiration, as this algorithm has not been commonly used for this purpose. In the case of the Rangpur station, the hybrid CNN-GRU algorithm outperformed other models, achieving the best values across various statistical metrics during both the training and testing phases. The highest correlation coefficient values of approximately 0.994 and 0.995. Moreover, during training and testing stages, the hybrid model had the lowest MAE (0.076, 0.068) and RMSE (0.138, 0.106) at the Rangpur station. Additionally, in the Sreemangal station, it can be notable that the statistical parameter RSME found superior results in the hybrid model around 0.225 and 0.174, respectively. In addition, the highest R2 and CE values were noted as 0.986, 0.987 and 0.985, 0.986 during the training and testing phases, respectively.

In the last few years, extreme weather swings due to climate change caused by global warming have caught the farming community off guard, especially in the developing world. One of the key objectives of smart agriculture is optimal use of freshwater, which has become an increasingly scarce resource around the world. Reference Evapotranspiration (ETo), an estimation of total flux of water evaporating from a reference surface is an important parameter for irrigation management. IoT & AI-based location-specific estimation of ETo for crop water requirements augments the decision-making process. In this work, we utilize the Hargeaves and Samani (H–S) model and six regression algorithms for the estimation of ETo. We create a location-specific dataset with locally sensed IoT data from a flood warning system and remotely sensed meteorological data, spanning over 5 years. We train and test Linear Regression (LR), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Radial Basis Function (RBF), Support Vector Regression (SVR), Bagging and Random Forest (RF) algorithms on the locally curated dataset with 20 basic, extracted, and derived attributes. We gradually reduce number of attributes in the dataset from 20 to 3 and compare performance of the six algorithms using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Relative Absolute Error (RAE), Root Relative Squared Error (RRSE), Coefficient of Determination R2, Kendall Tau and Spearman Rho metrics. SVR shows superior performance with an MAE of 0.03 and an RMSE of 0.05, followed closely by MLP with an MAE of 0.04 and RMSE of 0.06 with a dataset of 12 attributes. The performance of Bagging and RF algorithms remains relatively unchanged with feature reduction whereas RBF shows slight improvement in performance when number of attributes is reduced to 3. Finally, we develop a novel ensemble hybrid model using the Stacked Generalization technique, which outperforms all individual models in prediction accuracy when using reduced-feature datasets. This work clearly delineates the performances of a diverse set of ML algorithms for feature-rich and feature-scarce scenarios and demonstrates the efficacy of our hybrid ensemble ML algorithm for estimating ETo under limited availability of data in resource-constrained environments. © The Author(s) 2024.",,Fertilizers; Forward error correction; Linear regression; Time difference of arrival; Base function; Disaster preparedness; Mean absolute error; Multilayers perceptrons; Performance; Radial basis; Random forest algorithm; Root mean squared errors; Smart agricultures; Support vector regressions; Support vector regression,Yes,Yes,weather station,climate & meteorology,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Therefore, in this study, the ML-based soil moisture (SM) bias-correction model and solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) observation operator are incorporated into the land data assimilation system (LDAS). Thereafter, remotely sensed leaf area index (LAI), SM, land surface temperature (LST), and SIF data are assimilated to improve the performance of the Noah-MP model. The LDAS-ML framework is developed and evaluated in the Heihe River Basin of China. Analytical results suggest that the LDAS-ML system can fully exploit information from remotely sensed LAI, LST, and SIF data, along with multi-source SM observations, to enhance the accuracy of ET and GPP estimations. The root mean square errors (RMSEs) of daily ET (GPP) estimates from LDAS-ML at the Arou, Daman, and Sidaoqiao sites are 27.27 % (59.35 %), 51.71 % (56.28 %), and 61.07 % (53.73 %) lower than those of Noah-MP, respectively. Comparisons of the daily ET and GPP retrievals from the LDAS-ML method with three ET (GLEAM, ET-Monitor, and HiTLL) and GPP (GLASS, GOSIF-GPP, and VPM) products indicate that the LDAS-ML method outperforms the remote sensing products, yielding estimates with higher accuracy and lower relative uncertainty. Additionally, in arid and sparsely vegetated areas, the improvements in land surface models are more pronounced from integrating multi-source SM observations than vegetation information. This study suggests that ML methods can effectively exploit multi-source observations to improve the performance of LDAS and provide more accurate estimates of land surface variables. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",Land data assimilation; Machine learning; Multi-source observations; Noah-MP; SIF observation operator; Soil moisture bias-correction model,China; Gansu; Heihe Basin; accuracy assessment; data assimilation; estimation method; evapotranspiration; machine learning; observatory; primary production; remote sensing; satellite data,Yes,Yes,remote sensing,"climate & meteorology, vegetation indices, soil",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0

A framework is developed that integrates soil moisture from Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP), precipitation from the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM), evapotranspiration from the Ecosystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS), vegetation data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), soil properties from gridded National Soil Survey Geographic (gNATSGO), and land cover information from the National Land Cover Database (NLCD). Five machine learning algorithms are evaluated including the feed-forward artificial neural network, random forest, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), Categorical Boosting, and Light Gradient Boosting Machine. The methods are tested by comparing to in situ soil moisture observations from several national and regional networks. XGBoost exhibits the best performance for estimating soil moisture, achieving higher correlation coefficients (ranging from 0.76 at 0–5 cm depth to 0.86 at 0–100 cm depth), lower root mean squared errors (from 0.024 cm3/cm3 at 0–100 cm depth to 0.039 cm3/cm3 at 0–5 cm depth), higher Nash–Sutcliffe Efficiencies (from 0.551 at 0–5 cm depth to 0.694 at 0–100 cm depth), and higher Kling–Gupta Efficiencies (0.511 at 0–5 cm depth to 0.696 at 0–100 cm depth). Additionally, XGBoost outperforms the SMAP Level 4 product in representing the time series of soil moisture for the networks.

However, significant uncertainties persist in global ET estimates. Focusing on the area between 60°, we performed an intercomparison of 90 state-of-the-art ET products from 1980 to 2014. These products were obtained from various sources or methods and were grouped into six categories: remote sensing, reanalysis, land surface models, climate models, machine learning methods, and ensemble estimates. It is shown that global ET magnitudes of categories differ considerably, with averages ranging from 518.4 to 706.3 mm yr−1. Spatial patterns are generally consistent but with significant divergence in tropical rainforests. Global trends are mildly positive or negative (−0.10 to 0.37 mm yr−2) depending on categories but with distinct spatial variability. Evaluation against site measurements reveals various performances across land cover types; the ideal point error values range from 0.45 to 0.83, with wetlands performing the worst and open shrublands the best. Using the three-cornered hat method, there are spatial differences in ET uncertainty, with lower uncertainty for ensemble estimates, showing less than 15% relative uncertainty in most areas. The best global ET data set varies depending on the intended use and study region. Distinct spatial patterns of controlling factors across categories have been identified, with precipitation driving arid and semi-arid regions and leaf area index dominating tropical regions. It is suggested to include advancing precipitation inputs, incorporate vegetation dynamics, and employ hybrid modeling in future ET estimates. Constraining estimates using complementary data and robust theoretical frameworks can enhance credibility in ET estimation. © 2024.

In previous studies, a single machine learning model is often used to predict the factors related to drought, such as precipitation and temperature, to indirectly explain the influence degree of drought, but the overall prediction accuracy is low, which can not fully and effectively predict the nonlinear and non-stationary drought characteristic information. In this paper, the variational modal decomposition model (VMD) is used to decompose the meteorological drought time series, and the convolution neural network (CNN) and the improved bidirectional long short-term memory neural network (BiLSTM) are combined to construct the meteorological drought hybrid prediction model (VMD-CBiLSTM). The research results show that using VMD-CBiLSTM model to forecast the monthly daily evapotranspiration deficit index (DEDI) of three weather stations, compared with the results predicted by VMD-LSTM, VMD-BiLSTM and VMD-ARIMA models, the average prediction accuracy R2 is increased by 0.076, 0.034 and 0.328 respectively, and the average RMSE is decreased by 0.178, 0.094 and 1.373 respectively. Compared with single model, VMD-CBiLSTM can not only reduce the uncertainty of meteorological drought prediction caused by climate model heterogeneity, but also improve the accuracy of drought prediction in arid and semi-arid regions, which can provide reference for coping with drought occurrence and drought early warning in advance. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",Drought prediction; LSTM; Mixed model; VMD; VMD-CBiLSTM,Decomposition model; Drought prediction; LSTM; Meteorological drought; Mixed modeling; Modal decomposition; Variational modal decomposition model; Variational modal decomposition model-CBiLSTM; climate modeling; drought; early warning system; evapotranspiration; machine learning; weather forecasting; Prediction models,Yes,Yes,weather station,"climate & meteorology, vegetation indices",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0

Accurate estimation of ET is essential for enhancing efficient utilization of water resources, improving agricultural productivity, preserving ecosystems, and advancing climate change research. Despite its significance, high spatiotemporal resolution continuous ET datasets remain scarce. In ET estimation, machine learning methods have been widely adopted, with tree-based machine learning models gaining increasing attention due to their computational efficiency and reliability accuracy. However, research comparing the performance of these models remains relatively limited. In this study, we use data from flux observation sites and various remote sensing sources to explore the performance of four tree-based machine learning models in ET estimation across the Contiguous United States (CONUS). Our findings demonstrate the proficient performance of all four models in estimating terrestrial ET across CONUS. Particularly noteworthy is the outstanding performance of the extremely randomized trees (ERT) model, showing a high correlation (R2 = 0.84), low bias (BIAS = −0.0003 mm/d), and low root mean square error (RMSE = 0.72 mm/d) with flux observation site data. Using this model, we successfully obtained a seamless terrestrial ET dataset (ERT_ET) with a spatial resolution of 1 km and multiple temporal resolutions (daily, 8-day, monthly, and seasonal) from 2008 to 2018 across the CONUS. Compared to the MOD16 ET product, the ERT_ET outperforms with a higher R2 by 0.40 and lower RMSE by 5.31 mm/8d, providing better performance in capturing detailed features. Moreover, our ERT_ET product is comparable to other widely used ET products (MOD16, PML-V2, and ETMonitor), further highlighting its reliability. These findings will contribute to studies in various fields, including global climate change, hydrological cycles, and drought monitoring. © 2024 The Authors",Evapotranspiration; Machine learning; Remote sensing; Seamless dataset,United States; Climate change; Computational efficiency; Ecology; Evapotranspiration; Machine learning; Mean square error; Control factors; Flux observation site; Machine learning models; Machine-learning; Performance; Randomized trees; Remote-sensing; Seamless dataset; Terrestrial evapotranspiration; Tree-based; climate change; data set; estimation method; evapotranspiration; machine learning; numerical model; remote sensing; Remote sensing,Yes,Yes,remote sensing,climate & meteorology,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

However, its application in non-agricultural and natural environments has been limited, largely due to the lack of well-established Kc coefficients in these environments. Alternate Kc estimation approaches have thus been proposed in such instances, with techniques based on the use of leaf area index (LAI) estimates being quite popular. In this study, we utilised satellite-derived estimates of LAI acquired through the Google Earth Engine geospatial cloud computing platform and machine learning to quantify the water use of a commercial forest plantation situated within the eastern region of South Africa. Various machine learning-based models were trained and evaluated to predict Kc as a function of LAI, with the Kc estimates derived from the best-performing model then being used in conjunction with in situ measurements of ETo to estimate ETa. The ET estimates were then evaluated through comparisons against in situ measurements. An ensemble machine learning model showed the best performance, yielding RMSE and R2 values of 0.05 and 0.68, respectively, when compared against measured Kc. Comparisons between estimated and measured ETa yielded RMSE and R2 values of 0.51 mm d−1 and 0.90, respectively. These results were quite promising and further demonstrate the potential of geospatial cloud computing and machine learning-based approaches to provide a robust and efficient means of handling large volumes of data so that they can be optimally utilised to assist planning and management decisions. © 2024 by the authors.",crop coefficient; ensemble machine learning; geospatial cloud computing; leaf area index; water use,Cloud computing; Crops; Engines; Forestry; Machine learning; Water supply; Cloud-computing; Crop coefficient; Ensemble machine learning; Forest plantation; Geo-spatial; Geospatial cloud computing; Google earths; Leaf Area Index; Machine-learning; Water use; Evapotranspiration,Yes,Yes,remote sensing,"climate & meteorology, vegetation indices",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0

Draught forecasting often considers machine learning techniques that use climate-mode indices as predictor variables. However, forecasting in long lead times is still difficult due to the consequences of climate change and the difficulties associated with evaluating drought. In this study, a novel ensemble learning with optimized pruning model (EnsLOP) based on different deep learning models, i.e., multilayer perceptron (MLP), convolutional neural network (CNN), temporal convolutional feature network (TCFN) and Attention-driven LSTM Autoencoder (AttLSTMAE), is applied to improve the forecasting capability of draught index namely Standardised Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI). This study collects the preceding lag memory of climatic mode indicators such as rainfall, temperature, precipitation, and cloud cover as predictor variables to achieve significantly accurate draught forecasts. Also, a new flexible error correction (FEC) is proposed to reduce the prediction errors of the core predictors. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed EnsLOP model gained a distinct advantage in terms of SPEI prediction with comparatively low relative errors (RMSE =0.098 and R2 < 0.098). © 2024 Global NEST Printed in Greece.

This study investigates the intricate relationships between meteorological variables and evapotranspiration (ET) to enhance the accuracy of ET estimation models. Robust correlations were identified, emphasizing the significance of net radiation (Rn) in predicting ET. The study explores three distinct scenarios, incorporating different combinations of weather variables as input. The first scenario incorporates all weather variables, including date and time, as inputs for model development. The second scenario utilizes only Rn as input to predict ET values. In the third and final scenario, all weather variables, along with date and time, are employed as inputs for comprehensive model development. The multivariate linear regression (MLR) model demonstrated exceptional performance when exclusively using Rn, achieving an impressive R2 value of 0.99 in both calibration and validation phases. However, limitations were observed when Rn was excluded, highlighting the necessity of a comprehensive set of input data. Penalized regression models, including ridge regression, LASSO, and ELNET, exhibited improved performance with the inclusion of Rn, supporting the importance of this variable in refining ET estimates. Machine learning models displayed remarkable performance, with most achieving R2 values exceeding 0.95 in scenarios involving extensive input data. The Support Vector Regression (SVR) model faced challenges, indicating potential overfitting in certain scenarios. In scenarios with limited input data, machine learning models exhibited varying performance, with the Random Forest (RF) model emerging as the most robust model with R2 value of 0.99 and 0.84 during the calibration and validation, respectively. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature 2024.",,India; Udham Singh Nagar; Uttarakhand; accuracy assessment; calibration; crop; evapotranspiration; forecasting method; machine learning; model validation; regression analysis; resource allocation; water resource,Yes,Yes,weather station,"climate & meteorology, vegetation indices",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0
215,Raghav P.; Kumar M.; Liu Y.,Structural Constraints in Current Stomatal Conductance Models Preclude Accurate Prediction of Evapotranspiration,2024,10.1029/2024WR037652,"Evapotranspiration (ET) plays a critical role in water and energy budgets at regional to global scales. ET is composed of direct evaporation (E) and plant transpiration (T) where the latter is regulated via stomatal conductance (gsc), which depends on a multitude of plant physiological processes and hydrometeorological forcings. In recent years, significant advances have been made toward estimating gsc using a variety of models, ranging from relatively simple empirical models to more complex and data-intensive plant hydraulic models. Using machine learning (ML) and eddy covariance flux tower data of 642 site years across 84 sites distributed across 10 land covers globally, here we show that structural constraints inherent in current empirical and plant hydraulic models of gsc limit their effectiveness for predicting ET. These constraints also prevent the models from fully utilizing the available hydrometeorological data at eddy covariance sites. Even if these gsc models are calibrated locally, structural simplifications inherent in them limit their capability to accurately capture gsc dynamics. In contrast, a ML approach, wherein the model structure is learned from the data, outperforms traditional models, thus highlighting that there still is significant room for improvement in the structure of traditional models for predicting ET. These results underscore the need to prioritize improvements in gsc models for more accurate ET estimation. This, in turn, will help reduce uncertainties in the assessments of plants' role in regulating the Earth's climate. © 2024.

Because large uncertainties in estimating ETo can result in equally large uncertainties in determining water budgets and crop water requirements, and vice versa, accurate determination of ETo can be challenging when direct measurement and estimation with the Penman–Monteith (FAO-56-PM) semi-empirical equation of the food and agriculture organization (FAO) is not possible. Indeed, this study explores the use of the support vector regression machine learning algorithm (SVR) to predict daily ETo with limited measured inputs. It is the first time that Julian Day (J) is included as an input to improve prediction accuracy. Ten years of meteorological data collected at the Dar-El-Beidha weather station in Algeria are used, with maximum, minimum, and mean air temperatures (TM, tm, and T), mean relative humidity (RH), mean wind speed (u2), and sunshine duration (n) as inputs, as well as J and extraterrestrial solar radiation (Ra) as auxiliary variables, and the ETo-FAO-56-PM values as target outputs. Several SVR models are developed using different combinations of inputs, and their performance is assessed relative to ETo-FAO-56-PM values. Empirical equations are also used for comparison, and several evaluation metrics are employed, including root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), determination coefficient (R2), RMSE-standard deviation ratio (RSR), Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NSE), and Willmott’s refined index (WI). The results show that the SVR models utilizing limited meteorological inputs in addition to J and/or Ra predicted ETo accurately and outperformed their corresponding estimates using empirical equations, radial basis function neural networks (RBFNN), and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems (ANFIS) models obtained in previous studies. The RMSE ranged from 0.28 to 0.72 mm/day, R2 from 0.86 to 0.98, MAPE from 7 to 19%, RSR from 0.15 to 0.38, NSE from 0.86 to 0.98, and WI from 0.65 to 0.87.

Many machine-learning approaches were proposed for the simplification of Reference Evapotranspiration (ET0) predictions. There is also a need to explore the possibilities of daily Reference Evapotranspiration (ET0) predictions for the desert climate of Taif, Saudi Arabia. The study proposed machine learning-based daily Reference Evapotranspiration (ET0) predictions of Taif, Saudi Arabia. The weather data of Taif, from 2001 to 2023 is used to train and evaluate the performance of the Decision Tree Regressor (DTR), Extreme Gradient Boosting Regressor (XGBoostR), Random Forest Regressor (RFR), and Light Gradient Boosting Machine Regressor (LightGBMR) based machine learning models. The LightGBMR model outperformed other models for daily Reference Evapotranspiration (ET0) predictions of Taif, with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.998, a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.016 mm day−1, a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 0.128 mm day−1, and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.093 mm day−1, using twelve weather parameters. The feature importance of the LightGBMR model shows that weather parameters for ET0 predictions of Taif are important in order of wind speed (u2), maximum temperature (Tx), relative humidity (Rh), solar radiation (Rs), extraterrestrial radiations (Ra), saturation vapor pressure (es), actual vapor pressure (ea), minimum temperature (Tn), net long-wave radiation (Rnl), number of possible sunshine hours (N), net radiations (Rn), and number of actual sunshine hours (n). The Principal Component Analysis (PCA) shows that the top five weather parameters can capture 99.6% variance for ET0 predictions of Taif.

Additionally, empirical equations (EEs) such as Baier and Robertson (BARO), Jensen and Haise (JEHA), and Penman (PENM) models were considered. While the EEs demonstrated acceptable performance, the QR and ML models exhibited superior accuracy. Among these, the MLQR model displayed the highest accuracy compared to DVQR and BMAQR models. Moreover, LSSVR, XGBoost, and M5Tree models outperformed ELM and RF models. Notably, LSSVR, XGBoost, and MLQR models exhibited comparable performance (R2 and NSE > 0.92, MBE and RMSE < 0.5, and SI > 0.05) to M5Tree and BMAQR models across all climates. Importantly, these models significantly outperformed EEs, DVQR, ELM, and RF models in all climates.

Current differentiable models are efficient for NN-based parameter regionalization, but the simple explicit numerical schemes paired with sequential calculations (operator splitting) can incur numerical errors whose impacts on models’ representation power and learned parameters are not clear. Implicit schemes, however, cannot rely on automatic differentiation to calculate gradients due to potential issues of gradient vanishing and memory demand. Here we propose a “discretize-then-optimize” adjoint method to enable differentiable implicit numerical schemes for the first time for large-scale hydrological modeling. The adjoint model demonstrates comprehensively improved performance, with Kling–Gupta efficiency coefficients, peak-flow and low-flow metrics, and evapotranspiration that moderately surpass the already-competitive explicit model. Therefore, the previous sequential-calculation approach had a detrimental impact on the model’s ability to represent hydrological dynamics. Furthermore, with a structural update that describes capillary rise, the adjoint model can better describe baseflow in arid regions and also produce low flows that outperform even pure machine learning methods such as long short-term memory networks. The adjoint model rectified some parameter distortions but did not alter spatial parameter distributions, demonstrating the robustness of regionalized parameterization. Despite higher computational expenses and modest improvements, the adjoint model’s success removes the barrier for complex implicit schemes to enrich differentiable modeling in hydrology. © Author(s) 2024.

The aim of this study is to assess the global patterns and driving factors of three macronutrients, namely potassium (K), calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg), in freshly fallen litter. By synthesizing 5861 data points extracted from 584 publications, we quantitatively evaluated the concentrations of litter K, Ca and Mg in different litter types, life forms, taxonomic divisions and mycorrhizal associations. Also, using the machine learning method, we predicted their global patterns in forests, grasslands and shrublands. We found that (1) mean K, Ca and Mg concentrations ranged from 2.63 to 6.23, 1.05 to 11.50 and 0.20 to 2.74 g/kg, respectively, across different litter types; (2) the initial nutrients of the litter were significantly affected by plant functional types (e.g. life form, taxonomic division and mycorrhizal association), climate (e.g. isothermality, mean diurnal range, annual evapotranspiration and precipitation seasonality) and soil properties (e.g. pH, exchangeable Ca concentration and water content), with a higher litter K concentration of herbaceous plants, higher K, Ca and Mg concentrations from angiosperms and higher K and Mg concentrations from plants associated with arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) fungi; and (3) the predicted leaf litter K, Ca and Mg concentrations were lower in high-latitude regions compared with those in low- and/or mid-latitude regions. Our study provides a globally comprehensive analysis on the patterns and driving factors of three important macronutrients in freshly fallen litter, contributing to a better understanding of their role in the decomposition process of litter, as well as the associated biogeochemical cycles under the future climate change scenario.

In this work, supervised ML models were developed from a vineyard located in Talca, Chile, (i) to estimate actual evapotranspiration (ETa) (Model 1; M1) using the micrometeorological approach [Eddy Covariance; EC; sensible (H), latent (LE), soil heat fluxes (G) and net radiation (Rn)] and data from an automatic meteorological station (AMS) in reference conditions as ground-truth (inputs); (ii) to estimate energy balance components (Model 2; M2) from AMS data (inputs) and EC energy balance data as targets; (iii) to estimate ETa from the EC's measured ETa data as target and thermal time data (degree hours; DH) calculated from air temperature with a base of 5 °C increments from 5 – 45 °C as inputs (Model 3; M3) and iv) to estimate energy balance components (targets from EC) from the same inputs of Model 3 (Model 4; M4). Results showed that the developed ML models had high accuracy and performance with no signs of over or under-fitting with a high correlation (R) and slope (b) close to unity (M1; R=0.94; b=0.89; M2; R=0.97; b=0.93; M3; R=0.97; b=0.89–0.95; M4; R=0.98; b=0.97). Furthermore, models were directly deployed over another vineyard located 22 km West of the modeled vineyard at 60 m lower over the sea level with significant performances and R values (R = 0.64–0.87; b = 0.66–1.00 for M1 to M4, respectively).

The physics-informed machine learning (PIML) models effectively integrate conceptual hydrologic models with machine learning (ML) models. In this process, the intermediate variables of PIML models serve as bridges between inputs and outputs, while the impact of intermediate variables on the performance of PIML models remains unclear. To fill this knowledge gap, this study aims to encompass the construction of PIML models based on various hydrologic models, conduct comparative analyses of different intermediate variables based on a case study of 205 CAMELS basins, and further explore the relationship between the performance of PIML models and catchment characteristics. The optimal ML model for constructing PIML is first selected among four ML models within the 205 basins. The PIML models are then developed based on five monthly water balance models, namely TM, XM, MEP, SLM, and TVGM. To quantify the potential impact of difference in intermediate variables, two sets of experiments are further designed and performed, namely S1 with actual evapotranspiration as the intermediate variable and S2 with soil moisture as the intermediate variable. Results show that five PIML models generally outperformed the optimal standalone ML models, i.e., the Lasso model. Specifically, regardless of the choice of intermediate variables, the PIML-XM model consistently outperformed the other models within the same basins. Almost all constructed PIML models are affected by the intermediate variables in monthly runoff simulations. Typically, S1 exhibited better performance compared to S2. A greater impact of aridity index, forest fraction, and catchment area on model performance is observed in S2. These findings improve our understanding of constructing PIML models in hydrology by emphasizing their excellent performance in runoff simulations and highlighting the importance of intermediate variables. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",Environmental control factors; Intermediate variables; Monthly water balance models; Physics-informed machine learning,"Hydrology; Machine Learning; Models, Theoretical; Catchments; Environmental management; Forestry; Regression analysis; Runoff; Soil moisture; water; Control factors; Environmental control; Environmental control factor; Intermediate variable; Machine learning models; Machine-learning; Monthly water balance model; Performance; Physic-informed machine learning; Runoff simulation; catchment; evapotranspiration; hydrology; machine learning; runoff; soil moisture; water budget; Article; camel; catchment area; catchment area (hydrology); controlled study; drought; evapotranspiration; flooding; fluid balance; forecasting; forest; hydrological model; hydrology; machine learning; runoff; simulation; soil moisture; water supply; hydrology; theoretical model; Machine learning",Yes,Yes,Not Specified,"climate & meteorology, vegetation indices, soil",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0

In this study, we have undertaken the task of establishing a dataset of surface water isotopes (δ18O and δ2H) to create surface water isoscapes, and identify its controlling factors. Our analysis, utilizing a random forest model (RF), indicates that the isotopic patterns observed in precipitation are well-reflected in river water across China. Specifically, the δ18O isoscape in river demonstrates enrichment in the Western arid zone and depletion in the Tibetan Plateau. These patterns are strongly influenced by hydro-climatic factors such as relative humidity, precipitation, and catchment properties, such as elevation. Notably, elevation is a significant variable in the RF model, governing the isotopic composition (δ18O and d-excess) of rivers throughout China, primarily due to the rainout effect resulting in isotopically-depleted precipitation from lowlands to elevated mountain regions. In contrast, surface water d-excess isoscape reveals a more complex spatial variability in China, mainly associated with contrasting moisture sources including maritime vapor from tropical oceans and inland recycling vapor. In addition, secondary evaporation processes resulted from cumulative dams and developed irrigation systems also contribute to this variability. Hence, catchment-scale evapotranspiration and instream evaporative processes contribute to the enrichment of downstream river water isotopes. The predictive surface water isoscapes will help understand the impact of changes in the hydrological cycle on a larger scale and provide practical guidance for future monitoring efforts and isotopic simulations. © 2024",Isoscapes; Random Forest model; River water; Secondary evaporation processes; Stable isotopes,China; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau; Arid regions; Catchments; Evaporation; Forestry; Isotopes; Machine learning; Runoff; Water recycling; Evaporation process; Isoscape; Machine learning approaches; Random forest modeling; River water; Secondary evaporation process; Stable isotope data; Stable isotopes; Water isotope; δ+2$/H; catchment; evapotranspiration; hydrological cycle; isotopic composition; river water; runoff; Rivers,Yes,Yes,Not Specified,climate & meteorology,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
235,Yan Y.; Li G.; Li Q.; Zhu J.,Enhancing Hydrological Variable Prediction through Multitask LSTM Models,2024,10.3390/w16152156,"Deep learning models possess the capacity to accurately forecast various hydrological variables, encompassing flow, temperature, and runoff, notably leveraging Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to exhibit exceptional performance in capturing long-term dynamics. Nonetheless, these deep learning models often fixate solely on singular predictive tasks, thus overlooking the interdependencies among variables within the hydrological cycle. To address this gap, our study introduces a model that amalgamates Multitask Learning (MTL) and LSTM, harnessing inter-variable information to achieve high-precision forecasting across multiple tasks. We evaluate our proposed model on the global ERA5-Land dataset and juxtapose the results against those of a single-task model predicting a sole variable. Furthermore, experiments explore the impact of task weight allocation on the performance of multitask learning. The results indicate that when there is positive transfer among variables, multitask learning aids in enhancing predictive performance. When jointly forecasting first-layer soil moisture (SM1) and evapotranspiration (ET), the Nash–Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) increases by 19.6% and 4.1%, respectively, compared to the single-task baseline model; Kling–Gupta Efficiency (KGE) improves by 8.4% and 6.1%. Additionally, the model exhibits greater forecast stability when confronted with extreme data variations in tropical monsoon regions (AM). In conclusion, our study substantiates the applicability of multitask learning in the realm of hydrological variable prediction. © 2024 by the authors.",deep learning; hydrological variable forecasting; Long Short-Term Memory network (LSTM); multitask learning; relationship between variables,Brain; Efficiency; Learning systems; Long short-term memory; Runoff; Soil moisture; Deep learning; Hydrological variable forecasting; Hydrological variables; Learning models; Long short-term memory network; Memory network; Multitask learning; Performance; Relationship between variable; Variables prediction; data set; evapotranspiration; hydrological response; machine learning; prediction; soil moisture; Forecasting,Yes,Yes,Not Specified,"climate & meteorology, soil",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0

Direct leaf-level physiological parameters like net assimilation rate, stomatal conductance to water vapor, quantum yield of PSII, and transpiration can illuminate the rootstock effect on scion physiology. However, these measures are time-consuming and limited to leaf-level analysis. This study used different rootstocks to investigate the potential application of aerial hyperspectral imagery in the estimation of canopy level measurements. A statistical framework was developed as an ensemble stacked regression (REGST) that aggregated five different individual machine learning algorithms: Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso), Partial least squares regression (PLSR), Ridge regression (RR), Elastic net (ENET), and Principal component regression (PCR) to optimize high-throughput assessment of vine physiology. In addition, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) algorithm was integrated into an existing REGST, forming a hybrid CNN-REGST model with the aim of capturing patterns from the hyperspectral signal. Based on the findings, the performance of individual base models exhibited variable prediction accuracies. In most cases, Ridge Regression (RR) demonstrated the lowest test Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). The ensemble stacked regression model (REGST) outperformed the individual machine learning algorithms with an increase in R2 by (0.03 to 0.1). The performances of CNN-REGST and REGST were similar in estimating the four different traits. Overall, these models were able to explain approximately 55–67% of the variation in the actual ground-truth data.

This is particularly evident in the coffee industry, where fungal diseases like Cercospora coffeicola, causing brown-eye spot, can reduce yields drastically. This study focuses on forecasting coffee brown-eye spot using various models that incorporate agrometeorological data, allowing for predictions at least 1 week prior to the occurrence of disease. Data were gathered from eight locations across São Paulo and Minas Gerais, encompassing the South and Cerrado regions of Minas Gerais state. In the initial phase, various machine learning (ML) models and topologies were calibrated to forecast brown-eye spot, identifying one with potential for advanced decision-making. The top-performing models were then employed in the next stage to forecast and spatially project the severity of brown-eye spot across 2681 key Brazilian coffee-producing municipalities. Meteorological data were sourced from NASA's Prediction of Worldwide Energy Resources platform, and the Penman–Monteith method was used to estimate reference evapotranspiration, leading to a Thornthwaite and Mather water-balance calculation. Six ML models – K-nearest neighbors (KNN), artificial neural network multilayer perceptron (MLP), support vector machine (SVM), random forests (RF), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and gradient boosting regression (GradBOOSTING) – were employed, considering disease latency to time define input variables. Results: These models utilized climatic elements such as average air temperature, relative humidity, leaf wetness duration, rainfall, evapotranspiration, water deficit, and surplus. The XGBoost model proved most effective in high-yielding conditions, demonstrating high precision and accuracy. Conversely, the SVM model excelled in low-yielding scenarios. The incidence of brown-eye spot varied noticeably between high- and low-yield conditions, with significant regional differences observed. The accuracy of predicting brown-eye spot severity in coffee plantations depended on the biennial production cycle. High-yielding trees showed superior results with the XGBoost model (R2 = 0.77, root mean squared error, RMSE = 10.53), whereas the SVM model performed better under low-yielding conditions (precision 0.76, RMSE = 12.82). Conclusion: The study's application of agrometeorological variables and ML models successfully predicted the incidence of brown-eye spot in coffee plantations with a 7 day lead time, illustrating that they were valuable tools for managing this significant agricultural challenge. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.",agrometeorology; artificial intelligence; crop management; forecasting; python; Scikit-learn,"Ascomycota; Brazil; Climate; Coffea; Coffee; Forecasting; Machine Learning; Plant Diseases; Ascomycetes; Brazil; chemistry; climate; Coffea; coffee; forecasting; growth, development and aging; machine learning; microbiology; plant disease; prevention and control",Yes,Yes,"weather station, empirical models","climate & meteorology, vegetation indices",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0

Deficit irrigation (DI) reduces evapotranspiration, improving water efficiency in agriculture. Reference evapotranspiration (Formula presented.) is an important factor in determining DI. (Formula presented.) forecasting predicts field water consumption and enables proactive irrigation decisions, offering guidance for water resource management. However, implementation of (Formula presented.) forecasting faces challenges due to complex calculations and extensive meteorological data requirements. This project aims to develop a machine learning system for (Formula presented.) forecasting. The project involves studying (Formula presented.) methods and identifying required meteorological parameters. Historical meteorological data and weather forecasts were obtained from meteorological websites and analyzed for accuracy after preprocessing. A machine learning-based model was created to forecast reference crop evapotranspiration. The model’s input parameters were selected through path analysis before it was optimized using Bayesian optimization to reduce overfitting and improve accuracy. Three forecasting models were developed: one based on historical meteorological data, one based on weather forecasts, and one that corrects the weather forecasts. All three models achieved good accuracy, with root mean square errors ranging from 0.52 to 0.81 mm/day. Among them, the model based on weather forecast had the highest accuracy; the RMSE six days before the forecast period was between 0.52 and 0.75 mm/day, and the RMSE on the seventh day of the forecast period was 1.12 mm/day. In summary, this project has established a mathematical model of (Formula presented.) prediction based on machine learning, which can achieve more accurate predictions for within a few days. © 2024 by the authors.",agricultural irrigation forecasting; deficit irrigation; machine learning; water resource management; water resources,,Yes,Yes,weather station,climate & meteorology,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

We trained and validated CART models using data collected in a grassland terrain in northern Taiwan throughout the year of 2018, with the goal of providing precise information for agricultural irrigation and flood risk assessment. Results indicate the effectiveness of CART in SWC estimation, with error levels acceptable for agricultural purposes. The mean absolute error is less than 4% (v/v) for 53 out of the total 60 models in the 12-fold Time-Series Cross-Validation for SWC at depths of 10, 30, 50, 70, and 100 cm. Furthermore, the effectiveness of meteorological parameters in different sets of time shifting and parameter types are assessed. Our findings reveal that the responsiveness of SWC to parameters derived from precipitation varies with soil depth and season, with SWC dynamics in response to precipitation being more pronounced in shallower layers (≤50 cm) compared to deeper layers (≥70 cm). The influence of precipitation-derived and non-precipitation parameters on SWC dynamics is manifested in their distinct feature-importance characteristics in a CART model. This study highlights the importance of understanding characteristics of rainfall and underlying hydrological dynamics, such as evapotranspiration and soil texture, in order to make accurate SWC predictions using CART. Since CART serves as the basis for a variety of top-performing machines like random forest and gradient-boosted trees, the discoveries from this study can also help estimate SWC with these advanced algorithms.

However, the absence of solar radiation (Rs) data is a common problem affecting the estimation of ET0. This study investigates the feasibility of employing temperature-based models to estimate Rs and proposes effective methodologies for obtaining more convenient and accurate ET0 estimates. To evaluate the effectiveness of different approaches, authors compared nine empirical models (M1−M9) and three machine learning algorithms (RF, GRNN and ANN) for daily Rs estimation. This analysis utilized data from 339 national basic meteorological stations in China, spanning the period from 2001 to 2018. Subsequently, authors proposed two strategies for estimating daily ET0 in regions where solar radiation data is limited or unavailable. The results showed that (1) temperature-based models exhibited satisfactory accuracy (R2> 0.6) for daily Rs estimation, with machine learning algorithms outperforming their empirical counterparts. The machine learning accuracies are ranked as follows: Artificial Neural Network (ANN) > Generalized Regression Neural Network (GRNN) > Random Forest (RF). And empirical models are ranked in descending order of accuracy: M9 > M8 > M6 > M7 > M5 > M2 > M3 > M1 > M4. The accuracies of twelve models in the four climatic zones are indicated as follows: the temperate continental zone (TCZ) > the temperate monsoon zone (TMZ) > the subtropical monsoon zone (SMZ) > the mountain plateau zone (MPZ). (2) The comprehensive assessment for nine empirical models indicates that the Hargreaves-Samani model (M1) is the most reliable for solar radiation estimation. Its estimated results are close to those of the other models, and the coefficient of variation of the parameters (0.10) is much lower than that of the other empirical models. Thus, combining the model with the nationally calibrated parameters computed by the Kriging interpolation method allows for reliable values of the daily solar radiation. (3) Machine learning techniques show variations in estimating daily ET0 across different climate zones. The machine learning accuracies are ranked as ANN>GRNN>RF, and TCZ>TMZ>MPZ>SMZ in the four climate zones. (4) The accuracies of the two daily ET0 estimation strategies, with or without actual Rs calibration, are very close. Both strategies provide accurate daily ET0 estimates (R2>0.95) with an average R2 improvement of only 0.39% for strategy I compared to strategy II. In conclusion, this study provides new ideas to address the scarcity of solar radiation data and highlight the potential of machine learning in ET0 estimation. This approach can be effectively applied to reference crop evapotranspiration estimates in regions where solar radiation data is scarce. © 2024 Editorial Board of Chinese Journal of Agrometeorology.

In modern era of high technology, artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things have an important role to play in decision-making approaches. According to hydro-agrological studies, an accurate assessment of evapotranspiration is necessary for irrigation control, and to have an in-depth understanding of the environmental factor interactions, a sensitivity analysis should be carried out. One of the tools, alongside empirical equations, is artificial intelligence for time-series prediction. Thus, we compared several models for Penman–Monteith ET0 estimation to see which one performs better in the arid area of Morocco using meteorological data from the region of Fes. They were evaluated according to the MSE, RMSE, MAE, MAPE, and R2 and the variance of error distribution to show the performances of linear regression, K-Nearest Neighbor, decision tree, random forest, support vector regression, long short-term memory, and artificial neural network. According to the findings, LSTM outperformed the models with satisfactory results and an accuracy rate of 99.82%. An underlying mechanism of sensitivity analysis was also introduced to find the contribution of each element and estimate the target with a limited dataset. The findings show satisfactory results of R2 = 98.97%. The distribution and reliability of the prediction were proven using the Taylor diagram and Kruskal–Wallis test for the effectiveness of the study.

This study aimed to predict the long-term effects of climate change on the Gilgel Gibe watershed by integrating machine learning (ML) methods and climate model scenarios. Utilizing an ensemble mean of four regional climate models (RCMs) from the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) Africa project, we forecast future climatic conditions. Although global and regional climate simulations offer valuable insights, their limitations necessitate alternative approaches, such as ML, for improved accuracy. Employing an ensemble ML model with Random Forest (RF), Extra Tree (ET), and CatBoost (CB) algorithms, we assessed various bias-correction methods using historical data from 1993 to 2009. Our results highlight the effectiveness of distribution mapping (DM) in capturing temperature variability and precipitation patterns, using the power transpiration (PT) method to represent precipitation variability. Projections indicate a decline in future precipitation under the RCP 8.5 (−32.2%) and SSP 4.5 (−88.8%) for 2024–2049, with further decreases expected for 2050–2099. Conversely, temperatures will rise under RCP 4.5 (TMAX 0.67 °C) and RCP 8.5 (TMAX 0.25 °C and TMIN 1.11 °C) in the near term, exacerbated by higher emissions under SSP 4.5 and 8.5. By leveraging an ensemble mean of four observed RCMs in an ML framework, our study successfully reproduced future Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) and (CMIP6) climatic datasets, with the CB model demonstrating superior performance in predicting future precipitation and temperature trends.

In this paper, by coupling physical constraints and machine learning for hybrid modeling, we develop a hybrid model based on surface conductance optimization. A hybrid modeling algorithm, two physical process-based ET algorithms (Penman–Monteith-based and Priestley–Taylor-based ET algorithms), and three pure machine learning algorithms (Random Forest, Extreme Gradient Boosting, and K Nearest Neighbors) are comparatively analyzed for estimating the ET. The results showed that, in general, the machine learning model optimized by parameters was able to better predict the surface conductance of the hybrid model. Driver analyses showed that radiation, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and air temperature had high correlations with ET. The hybrid model had a better prediction performance for ET than the other five models, and it improved the R2 of the two physical process-based algorithms to 0.9, reduced the root mean square error (RMSE) to 0.5 mm/day, reduced the BIAS to 0.2 mm/day, and improved the Kling–Gupta efficiency (KGE) to 0.9. The hybrid model outperformed the others across different time scales, displaying lower BIAS, RMSE, and higher KGE. Spatially, its ET patterns aligned with regional vegetation changes, with superior accuracy in annual ET estimation compared to the other models. Comparison with other ET products shows that the estimation results based on the hybrid model have better performance. This approach not only improves the accuracy of ET estimation but also improves the understanding of the physical mechanism of ET estimation by pure machine learning models. This study can provide important support for understanding ET and hydrological processes under different climatic and biotic vegetation in other arid and semi-arid regions. © 2024 by the authors.",evapotranspiration; Heihe River Basin; hybrid model; machine learning; physical constraints,Adaptive boosting; Arid regions; Couplings; Forestry; Machine learning; Mean square error; Meteorology; Nearest neighbor search; Remote sensing; Rivers; Vegetation mapping; Watersheds; Heihe river basin; Hybrid model; Machine learning models; Machine-learning; Model coupling; Physical constraints; Physical process; Process-based; Root mean square errors; Surface conductance; Evapotranspiration,Yes,Yes,"remote sensing, empirical models","climate & meteorology, vegetation indices",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0
283,Diamantopoulou M.J.; Papamichail D.M.,Performance Evaluation of Regression-Based Machine Learning Models for Modeling Reference Evapotranspiration with Temperature Data,2024,10.3390/hydrology11070089,"In this study, due to their flexibility in forecasting, the capabilities of three regression-based machine learning models were explored, specifically random forest regression (RFr), generalized regression neural network (GRNN), and support vector regression (SVR). The above models were assessed for their suitability in modeling daily reference evapotranspiration (ETo), based only on temperature data (Tmin, Tmax, Tmean), by comparing their daily ETo results with those estimated by the conventional FAO 56 PM model, which requires a broad range of data that may not be available or may not be of reasonable quality. The RFr, GRNN, and SVR models were subjected to performance evaluation by using statistical criteria and scatter plots. Following the implementation of the ETo models’ comparisons, it was observed that all regression-based machine learning models possess the capability to accurately estimate daily ETo based only on temperature data requirements. In particular, the RFr model outperformed the others, achieving the highest R value of 0.9924, while the SVR and GRNN models had R values of 0.9598 and 0.9576, respectively. Additionally, the RFr model recorded the lowest values in all error metrics. Once these regression-based machine learning models have been successfully developed, they will have the potential to serve as effective alternatives for estimating daily ETo, under current and climate change conditions, when temperature data are available. This information is crucial for effective water resources management and especially for predicting agricultural production in the context of climate change. © 2024 by the authors.",daily reference evapotranspiration; generalized regression neural network; random forest regression; support vector regression,,Yes,Yes,empirical models,"climate & meteorology, vegetation indices",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0

This research aims to investigate the performance of two machine learning methods, the adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and the deep belief network (DBN), in forecasting PET, as well as to explore the potential of hybridizing the ANFIS approach with the Snake Optimizer (ANFIS-SO) algorithm. The study utilized a comprehensive dataset spanning the period from 1983 to 2020. The ANFIS, ANFIS-SO, and DBN models were developed, and their performances were evaluated using statistical metrics, including R2, Radj2, NSE, WI, STD, and RMSE. The results showcase the exceptional performance of the DBN model, which achieved R2 and Radj2 values of 0.99 and NSE and WI scores of 0.99 across the nine stations analyzed. In contrast, the standard ANFIS method exhibited relatively weaker performance, with R2 and Radj2 values ranging from 0.52 to 0.88. However, the ANFIS-SO approach demonstrated a substantial improvement, with R2 and Radj2 values ranging from 0.94 to 0.99, suggesting the value of optimization techniques in enhancing the model’s capabilities. The Taylor diagram and violin plots with box plots further corroborated the comparative analysis, highlighting the DBN model’s superior ability to closely match the observed standard deviation and correlation and its consistent and low-variance predictions. The ANFIS-SO method also exhibited enhanced performance in these visual representations, with an RMSE of 0.86, compared to 0.95 for the standard ANFIS. The insights gained from this study can inform the selection of the most appropriate modeling technique, whether it be the high-precision DBN, the flexible ANFIS, or the optimized ANFIS-SO approach, based on the specific requirements and constraints of the application. © The Author(s) 2024.",Adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system; Deep belief network (DBN); Forecasting; Hybrid artificial intelligence; Potential evapotranspiration; Snake optimizer,"Algorithms; Climate Change; Fuzzy Logic; Heuristics; Machine Learning; Models, Theoretical; Neural Networks, Computer; Climate change; Deep learning; Evapotranspiration; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy neural networks; Fuzzy systems; Learning systems; Optimization; Water management; Adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system; Adaptive-network- based fuzzy inference systems; Deep belief network; Deep belief networks; Hybrid artificial intelligences; Network models; Optimizers; Performance; Potential evapotranspiration; Snake optimizer; algorithm; climate change; forecasting method; hybrid; machine learning; optimization; performance assessment; potential evapotranspiration; prediction; algorithm; artificial neural network; climate change; fuzzy logic; heuristics; machine learning; theoretical model; Forecasting",Yes,Yes,Not Specified,"climate & meteorology, vegetation indices",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0

Climate change is expected to lead to increasingly extreme weather conditions, which may even increase the frequency and extent of these inundations. Shallow “floods”, also defined as inland excess water, are phenomena that occur due to a complex set of interrelated factors. Our research presents a workflow based on active and passive satellite data from Sentinel-1 and -2, combined with a large auxiliary data set to detect and predict these floods. The workflow uses convolutional neural networks to classify water bodies based on Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellite data. The inundation data were complimented with meteorological, soil, land use, and GIS data to form 24 features that were used to train an XGBoost model and a deep neural network to predict future inundations, with a daily interval. The best prediction was reached with the XGBoost model, with an overall accuracy of 86%, a Kappa value of 0.71, and an F1 score of 0.86. The SHAP explainable AI method showed that the most important input features were the amount of water detected in the satellite imagery during the week before the forecast and during the period two weeks earlier, the number of water pixels in the surroundings on the day before the forecast, and the potential evapotranspiration on the day of the forecast. The resulting inland excess water inundation time series can be used for operational action, planning, and prevention. © 2024 by the authors.",convolutional neural network; inland excess water; machine learning; Sentinel-1; Sentinel-2; water classification; XGBoost,Alfold; Hungary; Climate change; Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Deep neural networks; Evapotranspiration; Forecasting; Land use; Learning algorithms; Satellite imagery; Convolutional neural network; Excess waters; Inland excess water; Machine-learning; Satellite data; Sentinel-1; Sentinel-2; Water classification; Work-flows; Xgboost; algorithm; artificial neural network; flood; GIS; image classification; infiltration; potential evapotranspiration; precipitation intensity; prediction; satellite data; satellite imagery; Sentinel; severe weather; Floods,Yes,Yes,"weather station, remote sensing","climate & meteorology, vegetation indices",0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0

Assessing key vegetation indices (as yield predictors), along with understanding potential yield, yield gap, and major determinants for this gap at regional and national scales, is vital for improving food security with resilience in variable climatic conditions. Analysing the yield gap and its causes during drought and optimal weather conditions can reduce crop failure risks and enhance productivity specially in variable rainfed production systems. This study aimed to develop scalable methodology to predict field- and landscape-level yield and yield gaps for wheat and their underlying causes examplifying Morocco's rainfed production environment combining remote sensing, machine learning, and ground information. By analysing six vegetation indices (EVI2, CGVI, MSR, NDVI, OSAVI, and RVI) derived from Sentinel-2 satellite imagery (10 m resolution) over three successive growing seasons (2018–2019, 2019–2020, and 2020–2021), the study employed advanced vegetation index models for accurate prediction of wheat yields and yield gaps at plot and on a larger regional scale within the Rabat-Sale-Kenitra region. To identify the determinants of yield gap, climate and soil datasets were merged with crop management information and the random forest model was fine-tuned and assessed for each season and cumulatively. The findings highlighted that RVI, GCVI, and NDVI vegetation indices were particularly effective in predicting wheat yields, showing the highest R2 and the lowest prediction errors (RMSE). Such predictive methodologies are crucial for policymakers to proactively plan and mitigate risk minimization and adaption plans at regional and national levels. The models predicted rainfed potential yields of 5.99, 1.53, and 4.66 t ha−1, with corresponding yield gap of 3.38, 0.73, and 1.58 t ha−1 for the seasons of 2018/2019 (favorable); 2019/2020 (drought) and 2020/2021 (favorable), respectively. Across three periods, critical factors determining yield include soil moisture, total rainfall during the crop growing period, evapotranspiration, and soil texture and carbon content. To minimize drought risks and maximize benefits during variable rainfall conditions, it is essential to implement pre-season drought forecasts, customize seeding dates based on soil moisture, adopt technologies that enhance soil moisture retention, and utilize climate-adapted farming practices in the semi-arid and arid rainfed regions. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","Climate resilient drylands; Customized agronomic solution; Drought risk minimization; Predictors of yield gap; Vegetation indices (EVI2, CGVI, MSR, NDVI, OSAVI, RVI)",Morocco; Rabat-Sale-Kenitra; agronomy; crop yield; drought; machine learning; NDVI; prediction; remote sensing; risk assessment; satellite imagery; Sentinel; wheat,Yes,Yes,remote sensing,"climate & meteorology, vegetation indices, soil",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0

It has a variety of practical applications, ranging from understanding the hydrological cycle to estimating crop water needs for efficient irrigation in agriculture. The FAO PENMAN–MONTEITH (FAO-PM) method is largely adopted and is the recommended method by the FAO for ET0 estimation. However, it requires multiple measured meteorological parameters that are, in some conditions, difficult to obtain. This work fills this gap and leverages the potential of data-driven methods, namely machine learning and deep learning models, to accurately estimate ET0 while using a limited number of easy-to-obtain parameters. The study uses physical-based models (FAO-PM and Hargreaves) as ET0 learning data providers for data-driven models. First, physical models were fed with meteorological data covering the period 2013–2020 at an hourly scale to estimate ET0. The data were sourced from the in-situ local weather station of our study area in the Tensift basin (center of Morocco) and from the Copernicus ERA5-Land reanalysis data. Next, as a preprocessing step, feature engineering was performed using a decision tree-based approach. We evaluated the predictive importance of weather parameters for ET0 estimation. Scores between 0 and 1 were assigned to each parameter, indicating their efficacy. Notably, mean air temperature and global solar radiation stood out, collectively surpassing an 86% importance threshold. In contrast to the rest of the parameters that have a low importance of 10%. This emphasizes the critical significance of mean air temperature and global solar radiation as essential predictors for accurate ET0 estimation. Finally, during the modeling phase, three deep-learning models Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit, and Convolutional Neural Network are highlighted. Notably, the LSTM model exhibits superior performance, delivering comparable coefficients of determination (R2) and root mean square error (RMSE) results, surpassing its counterparts. In terms of univariate predictions using the Hargreaves and FAO-56 PM methods, the LSTM consistently achieves high R2 values of 0.90 across all data sources, accompanied by impressive accuracy reflected in low MAE, MSE, and RMSE values ranging from 0.004 to 0.07 mm/day. In addition, the ensemble learning model XGBoost had the best prediction performance with R2 = 0.93 and RMSE = 0.03 mm/day. This confirms that machine learning models outperform deep learning architectures for small and medium-sized datasets. The proposed models will be integrated into an under-development agricultural decision support system. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.",Deep learning; ERA5-Land reanalysis data; Evapotranspiration; FAO-56 Penman–Monteith; Hargreaves; Smart agriculture,Marrakech-Safi; Morocco; Tensift Basin; air temperature; decision support system; estimation method; evapotranspiration; hydrological cycle; machine learning; solar radiation; spatiotemporal analysis,Yes,Yes,"weather station, empirical models","climate & meteorology, vegetation indices",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0

This study investigates the efficacy of advanced Machine Learning (ML) techniques in enhancing rainfall prediction within hyper-arid environments. Leveraging an extensive 30-year dataset from 1991 to 2020, this study harnessed the power of XGBoost, LSTM, Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boost (GB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Linear Regression (LR), and ensemble methods to significantly enhance the prediction accuracy of monthly rainfall over UAE. In the initial univariate analysis, focused solely on rainfall as the predictor, the ML models displayed encouraging performance during the training phase, achieving an impressive correlation coefficient (CC) of 0.88 for both XGBoost and the ensemble models. However, their predictive efficacy witnessed a decline during the testing phase, where the maximum CC reached 0.45. In contrast, traditional models like Linear Regression and SVM, yielded subpar results in both training and testing, exhibiting correlation values lower than 0.3. To address these limitations, a multivariate analysis is conducted by incorporating additional meteorological parameters, including wind speed, temperature, humidity, and evapotranspiration. This augmentation proved highly beneficial as it substantially enhanced the models' predictive capacities during the testing period. The XGB achieves a CC of 0.76, LSTM improves from 0.21 to 0.71, and stacked models exhibit promising behavior jumping from an average of 0.44 to 0.82 during the testing periods. Additionally, we performed a sensitivity analysis utilizing LASSO regression, which revealed that wind speed and minimum temperature emerged as the most influential parameters for monthly rainfall prediction in the arid context. These two meteorological factors exerted a substantial impact on the accuracy of our predictive models, underscoring their significance in understanding and forecasting rainfall patterns in hyper-arid regions, such as the United Arab Emirates. The identification of these key drivers further strengthens the foundation for effective water resource management and climate adaptation strategies in such challenging environments. This study provides valuable insights for water resource planning, agriculture, and climate resilience strategies in hyper-arid regions.

As for cropland, accurate modeling of ETn is essential for rational water management and is important for sustainable agriculture development. We used random forest (RF) to simulate ETn at 16 globally distributed cropland eddy covariance flux sites along with remote sensing and meteorological factors. The recursive feature elimination method was used to remove unimportant variables. We also simulated the ETn of C3 and C4 crops separately. The trained RF resulted in a determination coefficient (R2) (root mean square error (RMSE)) of 0.82 (7.30 W m−2) on the testing dataset. C3 and C4 crops on the testing dataset resulted in an R2 (RMSE) of 0.86 (5.59 W m−2) and 0.55 (4.86 W m−2) for the two types of crops. We also showed that net radiation is the dominant factor in regulating ETn, followed by 2 m horizontal wind speed and vapor pressure deficit (VPD), and these three meteorological factors showed a significant positive correlation with ETn. This research demonstrates that RF can simulate ETn from crops economically and accurately, providing a methodological basis for improving global ETn simulations. © 2024 by the authors.",characteristics analysis; ecological remote sensing; machine learning; nocturnal evapotranspiration; random forest,alternative agriculture; data set; eddy covariance; evapotranspiration; machine learning; net radiation; remote sensing; vapor pressure; water flux; water management; wind velocity,Yes,Yes,"eddy covariance, weather station, remote sensing",climate & meteorology,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Various scenarios were examined utilizing meteorological data and FAO56-PM as a benchmark. According to the results, the ML models outperformed the experimental methods on both daily and monthly scales. Among the ML models, artificial neural networks (ANNs), generalized additive model (GAM), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM), respectively, demonstrated higher accuracy on a monthly scale, while ANNs, SVM, RF, and GAM exhibited greater accuracy on a daily scale. Notably, ANNs and SVM achieved high accuracy even with a limited number of variables. Conversely, RF showed improved accuracy with an increased number of variables. Comparing the ML and experimental models with equivalent inputs revealed that ANN with inputs similar to Valiantzas-1 performed better on a monthly scale, while SVM with inputs akin to Valiantzas-3 showed superior performance on a daily scale. Our findings suggest that average temperature, wind speed, and sunshine hours contribute significantly to the accuracy of ML models.

To evaluate the feasibility and accuracy of ET estimation in various climatic conditions using machine learning models, three-, six-, and nine-factor combinations (V3, V6, and V9) were examined based on the data obtained from global cropland eddy flux sites and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) remote sensing data. Four machine learning models, random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), extreme gradient boosting (XGB), and backpropagation neural network (BP), were used for this purpose. The input factors included daily mean air temperature (Ta), net radiation (Rn), soil heat flux (G), evaporative fraction (EF), leaf area index (LAI), photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD), vapor pressure deficit (VPD), wind speed (U), and atmospheric pressure (P). The four machine learning models exhibited significant simulation accuracy across various climate zones, reflected by their global performance indicator (GPI) values ranging from −3.504 to 0.670 for RF, −3.522 to 1.616 for SVM, −3.704 to 0.972 for XGB, and −3.654 to 1.831 for BP. The choice of suitable models and the different input factors varied across different climatic regions. Specifically, in the temperate–continental zone (TCCZ), subtropical–Mediterranean zone (SMCZ), and temperate zone (TCZ), the models of BPC-V9, SVMS-V6, and SVMT-V6 demonstrated the highest simulation accuracy, with average RMSE values of 0.259, 0.373, and 0.333 mm d−1, average MAE values of 0.177, 0.263, and 0.248 mm d−1, average R2 values of 0.949, 0.819, and 0.917, and average NSE values of 0.926, 0.778, and 0.899, respectively. In climate zones with a lower average LAI (TCCZ), there was a strong correlation between LAI and ET, making LAI more crucial for ET predictions. Conversely, in climate zones with a higher average LAI (TCZ, SMCZ), the significance of the LAI for ET prediction was reduced. This study recognizes the impact of climate zones on ET simulations and highlights the necessity for region-specific considerations when selecting machine learning models and input factor combinations. © 2024 by the authors.",climate zone; cropland evapotranspiration; eddy flux; input factor combinations; machine learning; remote sensing,Atmospheric pressure; Atmospheric temperature; Climate models; Forestry; Heat flux; Learning systems; Mean square error; Neural networks; Remote sensing; Support vector machines; Water management; Wind speed; Climate zone; Cropland evapotranspiration; Eddy fluxes; Input factor combination; Input factors; Leaf Area Index; Machine learning models; Machine-learning; Remote-sensing; Support vectors machine; Evapotranspiration,Yes,Yes,remote sensing,"climate & meteorology, vegetation indices, soil",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0

Accurate estimation of evapotranspiration (ET) is the first step in evaluating the water requirement of field crops. The solar radiation data are the essential input for estimating the reference crop ET (ET0 ). Due to expensive and difficulties in direct measurement techniques, solar radiation and ET0 were predicted using random forest machine learning (ML) and empirical methods. The water requirement for the tomato crop in millimetre/day is calculated using the estimated ET. Meteorological parameters associated with this study were obtained from India meteorological department and AQUASTAT tool. Based on the performance metrics such as MSE the value of 0.03 and correlation coefficient of 0.97, it is observed that solar radiation and ET0 predictions using random forest ML are better than the empirical model.

The most accurate ETc-adj estimates were observed with AB4 for I100, RF3 for I50 and AB5 for I0 with coefficients of determination (R2) of 0.992, 0.816 and 0.922, slopes of 1.004, 0.999 and 0.972, modelling efficiencies (EF) of 0.992, 0.815 and 0.917, mean absolute errors (MAE) of 0.125, 0.405 and 0.241 mm day−1, root mean square errors (RMSE) of 0.171, 0.579 and 0.359 mm day−1 and mean squared errors (MSE) of 0.029, 0.335 and 0.129 mm day−1, respectively. The AB model is suggested for ETc-adj prediction under I100 and I0 conditions, while the RF model is recommended under the I50 condition. © 2024 by the authors.",adaptive boosting; irrigation; machine learning; random forest; support vector machine; water stress,,Yes,Yes,empirical models,"climate & meteorology, soil",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0

Here, we synthesized eddy covariance data from 24 AmeriFlux sites distributed across the southeastern U.S., comprising 162 site-years of flux data representing six representative ecosystems including cropland vegetation mosaic (CVM), deciduous broadleaf forests (DBF), evergreen needle-leaf forests (ENF), grasslands (GRA), savannas (SAV), and wetlands (WET). Our objectives were to assess the daily, seasonal, and annual variability in ET and to develop practical predictive models for regional applications in ecosystem service analysis. We evaluated the response of ET to climatic and biotic forcings including potential evapotranspiration (PET), precipitation (P), and leaf area index (LAI), and compared the performance of these empirical ET models based and those developed using machine learning algorithms. Our results showed that the mean daily ET varied significantly, ranging from 1.36 mm d−1 in GRA to 2.30 mm d−1 in SAV, with a numerical order: GRA < DBF < ENF < WET < CVM < SAV. In this humid region, mean annual PET exceeded P in 16 out of the 24 flux sites. Using the Budyko framework, we showed that ENF had the highest evaporative efficiency (ET/P). PET and leaf area index (LAI) emerged as the most influential factors explaining ET variability. Artificial neural networks (ANN) and random forest (RF) models demonstrated superior capabilities in predicting monthly ET across sites over generalized additive modeling (GAM) and multiple linear regression (MLR) methods. The present study confirmed that the Southeast region is generally 'energy limited', implying that atmospheric demand along with vegetation information can be used to reliably estimate monthly and annual ET. Our study provides valuable insights into how ET of specific ecosystems is controlled by climatic and land surface drivers, enabling the development of reliable predictive models for regional extrapolation of flux measurements in water resource management in the humid southeastern U.S. region. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",Budyko; Eddy covariance; Land-use change; Machine learning; Modeling,United States; ecosystem service; eddy covariance; evapotranspiration; land use change; leaf area index; machine learning; numerical model,Yes,Yes,eddy covariance,"climate & meteorology, vegetation indices",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0

Reference evapotranspiration (ETo) stands as a crucial metric, embodying the influence of climate on water loss from both soil and plant surfaces. The accurate forecasting of future ETo values is paramount for informed decision-making in agricultural practices and water supply planning. The anticipation of evapotranspiration variations supports optimized irrigation, drought assessment, and efficient water allocation. Employing innovative algorithms, specifically the Multilayer Perceptron-Random Forest (MLP-RF) Stacked Model and the Correlated Nystrom Views (XNV), this study focuses on predicting ETo up to 60 days ahead in Agro Pontino, an area in Central Italy known for its flourishing agricultural production in the Mediterranean Europe. A Radial Basis Function (RBF) Neural Network serves as a benchmark. Taking into account firstly all available weather-climatic variables and subsequently adopting two different strategies for reducing the variables, based respectively on Principal Component Analysis and feature selection using Particle Swarm Optimization, three distinct sets of input variables were considered. The models based on the complete set of exogenous climatic variables demonstrated superior accuracy. However, even models relying on only mean temperature, maximum relative humidity, and shortwave solar radiation as inputs produced good results, also for the 60-day forecasting horizon, with Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) equal to 0.98 and 8.356 %, respectively, in the case of MLP-RF Stacked Model. The latter consistently outperformed XNV and RBF across various combinations of input variables and forecasting horizons. Notably, the reduction in accuracy with extended forecasting horizons was mild, suggesting the potential for accurate results over significantly more extended horizons. These forecasting models facilitate precise irrigation scheduling, minimizing water wastage and conserving resources. This targeted approach enhances crop yields, quality, and environmental sustainability, rendering agriculture economically viable and adaptable to climate variability. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",Correlated Nystrom Views; Feature Selection; Forecasting; Machine Learning; Reference Evapotranspiration; Stacked Model,Agro Pontino; Italy; Latina; Lazio; Climate models; Decision making; Feature Selection; Forecasting; Forestry; Irrigation; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Principal component analysis; Radial basis function networks; Sustainable development; Water supply; Central Italy; Climatic variables; Correlated nystrom view; Features selection; Input variables; Machine-learning; Multilayers perceptrons; Random forests; Reference evapotranspiration; Stacked model; agricultural production; algorithm; drip irrigation; drought; ensemble forecasting; evapotranspiration; forecasting method; solar radiation; Evapotranspiration,Yes,Yes,Not Specified,"climate & meteorology, vegetation indices",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0

In this study, at an irrigated pecan orchard in Northwest Mexico we explored the potential for three different machine learning algorithms to improve upon the 30-min ETact estimates provided by the FAO Penman-Monteith method (FAO-PM) when trained and tested on multi-year eddy-covariance measurements. We found that all three machine learning algorithms performed well (R2>0.9), with the Random Forest (RF) giving the best overall performance. RF consistently outperformed FAO-PM on sub-daily scales in the growing season, showing its potential to further improve sub-daily ETact estimates. In addition, RF 1) shows a clear improvement (R2 increase up to 0.168) compared to a typical FAO-PM estimate based on the procedures described in FAO report 56, and 2) mostly performed similar as FAO-PM with a highly accurate locally fitted crop factor on the seasonal scale. The latter highlights its ability to infer the correct seasonal trend through input variables that reflect the underlying physical processes, giving potential for application at other similar fields in the region with limited local tuning. To assess whether incorporating existing (semi-)physical parameterizations could improve the performance, we additionally combined our machine learning models with FAO-PM both with and without locally fitted crop factor. Overall, we found this resulted in a modest improvement in performance in most cases (R2 increase up to 0.01). Notably, incorporating the locally calibrated crop factor and FAO-PM each reduced the errors made by the RF in the second half of the growing season. This implies that it is still useful to incorporate FAO-PM and a crop factor in the machine learning model, especially when the crop factor can be determined with high accuracy. © 2023 The Authors",Actual evapotranspiration; Eddy-covariance; Irrigation; Machine learning; Semi-arid,Mexico [North America]; eddy covariance; evapotranspiration; irrigation system; machine learning; orchard; semiarid region,Yes,Yes,empirical models,climate & meteorology,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

Accurate prediction of evapotranspiration is of utmost importance in the strategic planning of agricultural irrigation, effective management of water resources, and precise hydrological modeling. The current investigation aims to predict the monthly ET values in the Elazig province by developing an artificial neural network (ANN) model utilizing the Levenberg–Marquardt method. Consequently, the values of temperature, precipitation, relative humidity, solar hour, and mean wind speed were utilized in forecasting evapotranspiration values by implementing ANN algorithms. This research makes a valuable contribution to the existing body of literature by utilizing an ANN model developed with the Levenberg–Marquardt method to estimate evapotranspiration. It has been discovered that evapotranspiration values are impacted by various factors such as temperature (minimum, average, maximum), relative humidity (minimum, average, maximum), wind speed, solar hour, and precipitation values, which are taken into consideration for prediction. The findings indicated that Elazig, Keban, Baskil, and Agin sites had R values of 0.9995, 0.9948, 0.9898, and 0.9994 in the proposed model. It was found that Elazig’s MAPE ranged from 0 to 0.2288, Keban’s was 0.0001 to 0.3703, Baskil’s was between 0 and 0.4453, and Agin’s was both 0 and 0.2784. The findings obtained from the proposed model are compatible with evapotranspiration values computed from the Hargreaves method (R2 = 0.996).

An improved version of the basin-based SEBALIGEE v1 is proposed in this paper. The improvement of SEBALIGEE v1, designated as v2, focuses primarily on incorporating advanced machine learning approaches which have enabled for the first time to implement SEBALIGEE over any scale application and enhance its overall performance. More particularly, an evaluation of the monthly ET estimated from the new algorithm across several fluxnet sites in the US, China, Italy, Belgium, Germany, and France, yielded a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 12.22 mm/month versus 14.54 mm/month in the original SEBALIGEE v1. Furthermore, we applied the new any-scale capability of SEBALIGEE v2 over the contiguous United States (CONUS) while emphasizing on the three main crops, including corn, soybeans and winter wheat. Our analysis indicated that all three crops presented two similar ET seasonal cycles with peaks occurring in late spring to the summer (May-Aug) and between October and January, corresponding well to the key stages of crop life cycle. Moreover, corn and soybeans exhibited similar magnitudes of ET (36 ∼ 168 mm/month) and higher than winter wheat (33 ∼ 122 mm/month), with large standard deviations observed in the ET estimates amogst all the crops. On interannual comparisons, the corn and soybeans ET and aKc showed higher values than winter wheat, with the highest and lowest years identified and discussed. Following an exploratory analysis against some of the most common interfering variables such as air temperature, dewpoint temperature, surface net solar radiation, wind speed, SPEI drought index calculated on 14 days and 30-days, it was noted that the surface net solar radiation had the most influencing factor on ET in corn and soybeans plantations with R2 values of ∼0.72. The SPEI-30 stands out for winter wheat, showing a water scarcity tolerance up to a month in most of its developing stages. Different management practices are then recommended in each of these two crops’ categories (corn and soybeans vs. winter wheat). © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",Crop water requirements; Google earth engine; Large-scale; Open-source; SEBALI; Water productivity,Belgium; China; France; Germany; Italy; United States; Budget control; Crops; Evapotranspiration; Interfacial energy; Life cycle; Solar radiation; Water supply; Wind; Crop water requirements; Google earth engine; Google earths; Large-scales; Open-source; Surface energy balance algorithm for land-improved; Surface energy balance algorithm for lands; Surface net solar radiation; Water productivity; Winter wheat; crop plant; evapotranspiration; machine learning; software; solar radiation; spatiotemporal analysis; water use; World Wide Web; Engines,Yes,Yes,Not Specified,"climate & meteorology, vegetation indices",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0

This study provides a probabilistic framework for determining the irrigation requirements of crops, referred to as the Irrigation Factor (IF). IF was calculated based on three indicators - soil moisture (SM), leaf area index (LAI), and evapotranspiration (ET). Irrigation requirement is determined based on a three-step methodology. First, relevant variables for each indicator are identified using a Random Forest regressor, followed by the development of a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to predict the three indicators. Second, errors in the simulation are calculated for each indicator by comparing the predicted and actual values in the historical time period, which are then used to calculate the error weights (normalized) of the three indicators for each month to also capture the seasonal variations. Third, we calculate the lower and upper limits by adding the error values (5th and 95th percentiles) to a simulated value. Using these values, we determine the mean, minimum, and maximum levels of irrigation requirement based on the levels’ threshold values. To determine the final levels of irrigation requirement at a daily time scale, we multiply the calculated levels (mean, minimum, and maximum) for each indicator by their respective weights. The outcome derived from the test case indicated that while certain variables exhibited no demand for water, there was a necessity for irrigation in other cases, and vice versa. This holistic approach to irrigation scheduling helps to ensure that plants receive adequate water while minimizing water wastage and promoting sustainability. It is especially valuable for agricultural operations, where optimizing water usage is essential economically and environmentally. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.",Agricultural water management; Irrigation scheduling; LSTM; Probabilistic framework; Random forest,Errors; Forecasting; Forestry; Long short-term memory; Soil moisture; Water management; Accurate prediction; Agricultural water management; Irrigation requirements; Irrigation scheduling; Leaf Area Index; Machine-learning; Mean maximums; Probabilistic framework; Probabilistics approach; Random forests; agricultural management; algorithm; holistic approach; irrigation; machine learning; probability; water management; Irrigation,Yes,Yes,Not Specified,"climate & meteorology, vegetation indices, soil",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0

This study aimed to evaluate the accuracy of three empirical models (Hargreaves-Samani (HS), Priestly-Taylor (PT), and Turc (TU)) and three machine learning models (Multiple linear regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), and Artificial Neural Network (NN)) in estimating daily ETo compared to the Penman-Monteith FAO-56 (PM) model. Long-term data from 42 weather stations in Florida were used. Moreover, the effect of ETo model selection on sweet corn irrigation water use was investigated by integrating simulated ETo data from empirical and ML models using the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) model at two locations (Citra and Homestead) in Florida. Furthermore, a linear bias correction calibration technique was employed to improve the performance of empirical models. Results were consistent in that the NN and RF models outperformed the empirical models. The empirical models tended to underestimate and overestimate small and high daily ETo values, respectively, with the HS model exhibiting the least accuracy. However, calibrated PT and TU models performed comparably to the ML models. Results also revealed that using an inappropriate ETo model could lead to over-irrigation by up to 54 mm during a single crop season. Overall, ML models have proven reliable alternatives to the PM model, especially in regions with access to long-term data due to their site-independent performance. In areas without long-term data for ML model training and testing, calibrating empirical models is viable, but site-specific calibration is needed. It is important to highlight that distinct plant species exhibit varying transpiration characteristics and, consequently, have different water requirements. These differences play a pivotal role in shaping the overall impact of ETo models on crop water use. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",Agriculture; Florida; Irrigation; Sweet corn; Vegetable; Water resources,Citra; Florida [United States]; Homestead; United States; Agricultural technology; Calibration; Crops; Decision making; Evapotranspiration; Forestry; Information management; Irrigation; Linear regression; Machine learning; Neural networks; Water management; Water supply; water; Agrotechnology transfer; Daily evapotranspirations; Empirical model; Evapotranspiration models; Florida; Hargreaves; Penman Monteith; Performance; Sweet corns; Waters resources; evapotranspiration; irrigation system; machine learning; maize; modeling; vegetable; water management; water resource; water use; Article; artificial neural network; controlled study; decision support system; environmental impact; evapotranspiration; feature selection algorithm; Florida; Hargreaves test; irrigation (agriculture); machine learning; multiple linear regression analysis; nonhuman; random forest; simulation; sweet corn; water management; article; calibration; decision support system; sweating; sweet corn; vegetable; water supply; weather; Decision support systems,Yes,Yes,"weather station, empirical models","climate & meteorology, vegetation indices",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0

This investigation aimed to study the performance of regression techniques and machine learning (ML) techniques in estimating daily reference evapotranspiration (ET0) and compare them to the ET0 computed by the Penman–Monteith (PM-56) technique of “Food and Agriculture Organization” (FAO). The study used the meteorological data of the Pusa Institute, ICAR-IARI, New Delhi, which is located in a semi-arid climatic zone, for a period of 31 years (1990–2020). Six regression techniques were used, including multiple linear regression (MLR), elastic net regression (ENR), ridge regression (RDR), lasso regression (LASSOR), partial least square regression (PLSR), and Poisson regression (POR). Four machine learning models, namely radial basis function (RBF), M5Tree, locally weighted learning (LWL), and gradient boosted tree (GBT), were also evaluated for predicting daily ET0. The M5Tree model outclassed all other models in predicting daily ET0, with a mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), root-mean-squared error (RMSE), R-squared (R2), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and Willmott's index (d) of 0.088, 0.018, 0.136, 0.994, 3.073%, and 0.914, respectively, in training of the models. While during testing period, M5Tree model gave MAE, MSE, RMSE, R2, MAPE and d values as 0.114, 0.16, 0.382, 0.949, 3.946% and 0.988, respectively. During training phase, the GBT model reported MAE, MSE, RMSE, R2, MAPE and d as 0.097, 0.021, 0.145, 0.993, 3.257% and 0.998, respectively, which were slightly poor than the M5Tree model.

While the Penman-Monteith (PM) equation is widely recognized for ET0 calculation, its reliance on numerous meteorological parameters constrains its practical application. This study used 28 years of meteorological data from 18 stations in four geographic regions of Taiwan to evaluate the effectiveness of an artificial intelligence (AI) model for estimating PM-calculated ET0 using limited meteorological variables as input and compared it with traditional methods. The AI models were also employed for short-term ET0 forecasting with limited meteorological variables. The findings suggested that AI models performed better than their counterpart methods for ET0 estimation. The artificial neural network using temperature, solar radiation, and relative humidity as input variables performed best, with the correlation coefficient (r) ranging from 0.992 to 0.998, mean absolute error (MAE) ranging from 0.07 to 0.16 mm/day, and root mean square error (RMSE) ranging from 0.12 to 0.25 mm/day. For short-term ET0 forecasting, the long short-term memory model using temperature, solar radiation, and relative humidity as input variables was the best structure to forecast four-day-ahead ET0, with the r ranging from 0.608 to 0.756, MAE ranging from 1.05 to 1.28 mm/day, and RMSE ranging from 1.35 to 1.62 mm/day. The percentage error of this structure was within (Formula presented.) 5% for most meteorological stations over the one-year test period, underscoring the potential of the proposed models to deliver daily ET0 forecasts with acceptable accuracy.

This study proposes a novel approach that leverages ensemble models and correlation analysis based on Landsat-8 satellite data to forecast LST and explore its environmental relationships. Time-series satellite data spanning winter and summer seasons of 2018–2019 was retrieved from the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. LST, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), rainfall, and evapotranspiration (ET) datasets were derived from Landsat-8 data within GEE to facilitate LST modeling. The ensemble framework combines three powerful machine learning algorithms: XG-Boost, Bagging-XG-Boost, and AdaBoost, to enhance the accuracy and robustness of LST predictions. Compared to standalone models, the proposed ensemble models demonstrated significant improvements in LST prediction accuracy. While XG-Boost and AdaBoost achieved moderate accuracies with R2 values of 0.57 and 0.60, respectively, the Bagging ensemble model surpassed them with an outstanding R2 of 0.75. Furthermore, a correlation analysis by using linear regression (LR) model explored the relationships between ET, rainfall, NDVI, and LST. The analysis revealed strong positive correlations between NDVI and ET (R2 = 0.95), while correlations between NDVI and LST (R2 = 0.31) and NDVI and rainfall (R2 = 0.47) were weaker.

However, the utility of PRI in combination with SIF for transpiration (T) estimation has not yet been explored. Additionally, current SIF-driven transpiration models including linear models, semi-mechanical models (combination of canopy conductance, gC, derived from a SIF and vapor pressure deficit, VPD, driven linear model with the Penman-Monteith model), and hybrid models (combination of gC derived from a SIF and VPD driven machine learning model with the Penman-Monteith model) have rarely been mutually assessed. Based on concurrent remotely sensed SIF and PRI, and eddy covariance flux measurements during one growing season for a winter wheat ecosystem in northern China, we investigated the mediating effect of PRI on SIF-driven T estimation under different VPD conditions and compared the performance of linear, semi-mechanical, and hybrid models in estimating T. Our results showed that the mediating effect of PRI on T described in the SIF-driven linear, semi-mechanistic, and hybrid models was significant under high VPD conditions rather than under low VPD conditions. Specifically, based on T partitioned using an underlying water use efficiency method as a benchmark, the root mean square error (RMSE) value of the PRI-mediated linear, semi-mechanistic, and hybrid models was 28.01 W/m2, 22.25 W/m2, and 28.71 W/m2 lower, respectively, than those of the corresponding models without PRI when VPD was >1.5 kPa. Based on T partitioned using a transpiration estimation algorithm as a benchmark, these three models also exhibited a significant reduction in RMSE under high VPD conditions after considering PRI. The main rationale behind the PRI improvement is that PRI can track photosynthetic dynamics under high VPD conditions. Based on the simulation results of the Soil-Canopy-Observation of Photosynthesis and Energy fluxes (SCOPE) model, PRI can serve as an indicator for non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) within this ecosystem. Consequently, PRI can enhance the capability of SIF to characterize the energy dissipation of photosynthetically active radiation and help SIF to yield more accurate information on GPP and gc under high VPD conditions. Finally, the order of model performance in estimating T was generally hybrid model > semi-mechanistic model > linear model. Our findings show the effectiveness of PRI for improving SIF-driven transpiration estimation under high VPD conditions and provide a new hybrid model for estimating T from SIF. © 2023",Hybrid model; Non-photochemical quenching; Photochemical reflectance index; SCOPE model; Sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence; Transpiration,China; Chlorophyll; Crops; Energy dissipation; Fluorescence; Mean square error; Photosynthesis; Plants (botany); Quenching; Reflection; Transpiration; Chlorophyll fluorescence; Condition; Energy flux model; Hybrid model; Linear modeling; Non-photochemical quenching; Photochemical reflectance index; Semi-mechanistic models; Soil-canopy-observation of photosynthesis and energy flux model; Sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence; algorithm; energy dissipation; fluorescence; numerical model; photochemistry; photosynthetically active radiation; spectral reflectance; transpiration; water use efficiency; wheat; Ecosystems,Yes,Yes,"eddy covariance, empirical models","climate & meteorology, vegetation indices, plant physiology",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1

These stresses may be accelerating environmental degradation and desertification of soil in NEB. The main aim of this study was to gain geospatial insights into the biophysical parameters of surface energy balance and actual evapotranspiration on a multi-temporal scale, aiming to detect and analyze the spectral behavioral patterns of areas vulnerable to degradation processes, based on thematic maps at the surface, for NEB and mainly the semiarid region of NEB from 2000 to 2019. Geospatial data from 8-day MODIS sensor products were used, such as surface reflectance (Terra/MOD09A1 and Aqua/MYD09A1), surface temperature (Terra/MOD11A2 and Aqua/MYD11A2), and actual evapotranspiration (Terra/MOD16A2 and Aqua/MYD16A2), version 6. Therefore, in this study, pixel-to-pixel values were processed by calculating the average pixel statistics for each year. From the reflectance product, digital processing of the surface albedo and spectral vegetation indices was also carried out, using computational programming scripts and machine learning algorithms developed via the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. The study also presents a seasonal analysis of these components and their relationships over 20 years. Through vegetation indices and statistical correlations, a new predictive model of actual evapotranspiration was developed. The quantitative and spatiotemporal spectral patterns of the parameters were assessed through descriptive statistics, measures of central tendency and dispersion, and statistical error analyses and correlation indices. Thematic maps highlighted the pixel-to-pixel results, with patterns of high temperature distribution mainly in the central and northeastern part of NEB and the semiarid region of NEB, highlighting the formation of persistent heat islands over time. Meanwhile, in these areas, the maps of actual evapotranspiration showed a drastic reduction due to the lesser availability of energy. Over time, the semiarid region of NEB presented areas with little and/or no vegetation cover, which were highly well-defined between the years 2012 and 2019, confirming that these areas are extremely vulnerable to degradation and desertification processes due to significant loss of vegetative and water resilience. The components of energy balance were highly interconnected to climatological and environmental conditions, showing the severe results of drought and accentuation of the water deficit in NEB, presenting a greater condition of aridity in the semiarid region of NEB over time. © 2024 by the authors.",biophysical parameters; climate variability; evapotranspiration; remote sensing; severe drought; water deficit,,Yes,Yes,remote sensing,"climate & meteorology, vegetation indices",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0

Therefore, it is necessary to map and analyze the factors that control the yield components to optimize wine production and profitability. The objective of this study was to identify the ranked effects of environmental and agrotechnical factors (e.g., meteorological, physiological, vegetative, and irrigation) on grapevine yield, number of clusters, and cluster weight, and to quantify their patterns. To achieve this objective, a multi-experiment database was used, assembling data collected during four long-term irrigation experiments including different varieties and diverse climatic regions across Israel. First, a paired analysis of the yield components was conducted to define the relationships among them. Then, prediction models for the three variables (i.e., yield components) were designed using the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm to explore the ranked effects and patterns of the controlling factors. Validation was conducted using a test set, consisting of 20 % of the dataset. The relationships between yield and cluster weight (0 < r < 0.73) and between yield and the number of clusters were always positive (0.67 < r < 0.77), while negative relationships were found between cluster weight and number of clusters (-0.61 < r < 0). The accuracy of the prediction models was high, with mean absolute errors (normalized to the range) ranging between 4.1 % and 8.11 %. The most dominant factors affecting yield components were cumulative leaf area index, accumulated growing degree days (GDD), cumulative irrigation, and evapotranspiration. Leaf area showed an optimum point, below and above which the values of the yield components decrease; GDD negatively affected yield and cluster weight but had a positive effect on the number of clusters; irrigation was positively associated with yield components but leveled out above 348–395 mm per season. Reference evapotranspiration had a negative effect on yield and cluster weight, and a generally positive effect on the number of clusters. Utilizing data from multiple experiments and applying multivariate analysis, allow to define general patterns of relationships and interactions between controlling factors and yield components. Extracting this knowledge from the data and managing the growing amounts of information can be achieved through complex modeling and the implementation of standard protocols for data collection and monitoring. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",Leaf area index; Machine learning; Support vector machine; Vine physiology; Vitis vinifera; Yield components,Israel; agricultural practice; crop yield; drip irrigation; evapotranspiration; irrigation system; leaf area index; machine learning; phenology; spatiotemporal analysis; vine; vineyard; yield response,Yes,Yes,weather station,"climate & meteorology, vegetation indices, plant physiology",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1

In this study, three tree-based machine learning algorithms (random forest [RF], gradient boosting decision tree [GBDT], and extreme gradient boosting [XGBoost]) were adopted to determine the essential factors for ETO prediction. The tree-based models were optimized using the Bayesian optimization (BO) algorithm and were compared with three standalone models in terms of daily ETO and monthly mean ETO estimations in North China, with different input combinations of essential variables. The results indicated that solar radiation (Rs) and air temperature (Ts), including the maximum, minimum, and average temperatures, in daily ETO were the key variables affecting model prediction accuracy. Rs was the most influential factor in the monthly average ETO model followed by Ts. Both relative humidity (RH) and wind speed at 2 m (U2) had little impact on ETO prediction at different scales, although their importance differed. Compared with the GBDT and RF models, the XGBoost model exhibited the best performance for daily ETO and monthly mean ETO estimations. The hybrid tree-based models with the BO algorithm outperformed standalone tree-based models. Overall, compared with the other inputs, the model with three inputs (Rs, Ts, and RH/U2) had the highest accuracy. The BO-XGBoost model exhibited superior performance in terms of the global performance index (GPI) for daily ETO and monthly mean ETO predictions and is recommended as a more accurate model for predicting daily ETO and monthly mean ETO in North China or areas with a similar climate. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature 2023.",Bayesian optimization; Essential factors; Machine learning; Reference crop evapotranspiration; Tree-based algorithms,China; algorithm; Bayesian analysis; estimation method; evapotranspiration; hydrological change; machine learning; numerical model; regression analysis,Yes,Yes,Not Specified,climate & meteorology,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

One such notable disease in coffee crops is caused by the fungus Phoma spp. This pathogen leads to several symptoms detrimental to coffee plants, such as leaf lesions, drying of branches, and rotting of flowers and fruits. These symptoms often result in the dropping of the affected parts, subsequently leading to a decrease in the overall yield of the coffee crop. In response to this challenge, our objective was to develop a forecasting model for the incidence of Phoma leaf spot in Brazilian coffee crops, utilizing advanced machine learning algorithms. This approach is intended to predict disease outbreaks, thereby enabling timely and effective management strategies to mitigate the impact on coffee yield. The study was conducted in two stages: (1) calibration of machine learning models for locations (Boa Esperança, Carmo de Minas, Muzambinho, Varginha, Araxá, Araguari, and Patrocínio) with field data between 2010 and 2022; (2) Phoma leaf spot incidence forecast in municipalities of coffee-producing states in Brazil [Paraná (PR), São Paulo (SP), Rio de Janeiro (RJ), Espírito Santo (ES), Minas Gerais (MG), Goiás (GO), and Bahia (BA)]. Thirty-year climate data were retrieved from the NASA/POWER platform. Reference evapotranspiration was estimated by the Penman–Monteith method, generating water balance according to Thornthwaite and Mather (1955). To understand the effect of climate variables on the disease incidence, Pearson’s univariate correlation was performed for each location. We used six algorithms to forecast the disease incidence, considering a 7-day latency period to define input variables. It is noteworthy that the evaluated locations present similar climatic conditions. Summer was the hottest and rainiest period, while winter was the coldest and driest. Annual averages of air temperature, cumulative rainfall, potential evapotranspiration, soil water storage, and incident radiation were 21.1 °C, 1208.9 mm, 1283.2 mm, 58.0 mm, 435.7 mm, and 18.1 MJ m2 day−1, respectively. The XGBoost model demonstrated superior performance for both high- and low-yield coffee trees, achieving an impressive precision (R2fit) of 0.46 and 0.51, respectively. Additionally, it exhibited high accuracy, with Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) values of 3.45% for high-yielding and 3.16% for low-yielding trees. In contrast, the multilayer perceptron (MLP) model displayed suboptimal results under both yield conditions. Given these findings, the XGBoost model proves effective in predicting the incidence of the disease at least 7 days ahead, based on the parameters applied in this study. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature 2023.",,Brazil; coffee; disease incidence; forecasting method; fungal disease; fungus; machine learning; model,Yes,Yes,empirical models,"climate & meteorology, vegetation indices",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0

Artificial intelligence-based models are a promising alternative to the most common direct ETa estimation techniques and indirect methods by remote sensing (RS)-based surface energy balance models. Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are proven to be suitable for predicting reference evapotranspiration (ETo) and ETa based on RS data. This study aims to develop a methodology based on ANNs for estimating daily ETa values using NDVI and land surface temperature, coupled with limited site-specific climatic variables in a large irrigation catchment. The ANN model has been applied to the two different scenarios. Data from only the 38 days of satellite overpass dates was selected in Scenario I, while in Scenario II all datasets, i.e., the 769-day data were used. An irrigation scheme, located in the Mediterranean region of Turkiye, was selected, and a total of 38 Landsat images and local climatic data collected in 2021 and 2022 were used in the ANN model. The ETa results by the ANN model for Scenarios I and II showed that the R2 values for training (0.79 and 0.86), testing (0.75 and 0.81), and the entire dataset (0.76 and 0.84) were all remarkably high. Moreover, the results of the new ANN model in two scenarios showed an acceptable agreement with ETa-METRIC values. The proposed ANN model demonstrated the potential for obtaining daily ETa using limited climatic data and RS imagery. As a result, the suggested ANN model for daily ETa computation offers a trustworthy way to determine crop water usage in real time for sustainable water management in agriculture. It may also be used to assess how crop evapotranspiration in drought-prone areas will be affected by climate change in the 21st century. © 2024 by the authors.",artificial neural networks (ANNs); climate change; evapotranspiration; METRIC model; remote sensing (RS); sustainability,Turkey; climate change; energy balance; evapotranspiration; land surface; Landsat thematic mapper; NDVI; remote sensing,Yes,Yes,remote sensing,"climate & meteorology, vegetation indices",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0

Its dynamics are intricately linked to the interplay among water balance, energy balance, and land use. However, the precise estimation of ET at a regional scale, coupled with a comprehensive understanding of its response to changes in water, heat, and vegetation factors, presents an ongoing challenge. In this study, we assessed the necessity to refine soil evaporation simulations in arid and semiarid regions. Subsequently, we introduced the random forest algorithm to optimize the soil evaporation module of the Priestley-Taylor Jet Propulsion Laboratory (PT-JPL) model to enable a more accurate prediction of ET. Then, we quantitatively explored the correlation between ET and pertinent factors, such as soil moisture, solar radiation, and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) in the Inner Mongolia section of the Yellow River Basin (IMSYRB), which is a typical arid and semiarid region. The findings underscore that soil evaporation is the predominant constituent of ET in the IMSYRB. Moreover, soil moisture, as opposed to relative humidity, better represent the near-surface moisture conditions within the study area. The refined model (PT-JPL-RF) exhibited enhanced simulation performance at both individual stations and in the overall region for ET. Furthermore, the application of the PT-JPL-RF model for scrutinizing the spatiotemporal ET variations in the study area revealed an average ET of 250 mm over the past four decades. Since 1982, a fluctuating upward trend of 0.99 mm/year has been observed. Spatially, ET exhibits an eastward distribution, with elevated values in the eastern sectors compared to those in the western regions, particularly in the Big Black River Basin (296 mm). Vegetation was the primary factor influencing ET variations in the IMSYRB, contributing to an annual increase by 1.58 mm. These findings demonstrate the benefits of integrating machine learning algorithms with physical models and provide a practical example for accurately simulating and predicting ET across diverse regions. © 2024 The Authors",Arid and semiarid region; Contribution analysis; Evapotranspiration optimization; PT-JPL; Random forest; Soil moisture,Cheboygan Basin; China; Michigan; Nei Monggol; United States; Arid regions; Evaporation; Evapotranspiration; Forestry; Land use; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Vegetation; Watersheds; Arid and semi-arid regions; Contribution analysis; Evapotranspiration optimization; Inner Mongolia; Jet Propulsion Laboratory; Optimisations; Priestley-Taylor; Priestley-taylor jet propulsion laboratory; Random forests; Soil evaporations; algorithm; arid region; evaporation; evapotranspiration; machine learning; NDVI; optimization; semiarid region; soil moisture; Soil moisture,Yes,Yes,empirical models,"climate & meteorology, vegetation indices, soil",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0

Subsequently, using microwave data, the Surface Energy Balance System model and Machine Learning methods, it calculated a complete set of long-term evapotranspiration data. At the same time, based on reasonable assumptions, it also estimated the total evaporation from plateau lakes.

A possible improvement of early forest disturbance detection?,2024,10.3389/ffgc.2024.1445094,"Forest ecosystems are long-term exposed to dry periods in Europe, which leads to a significant loss of vitality and higher mortality, especially in coniferous forests. Identifying stress in the early stages when measures can be taken to protect the forest and living trees is crucial. Current detection methods are based on field surveys by forest workers or remote sensing methods to cover larger areas, which use changes in spectral reflectance of the forest canopy. In some cases, the attacked trees do not change their appearance, and based on calculations of vegetation indices from remote sensing data, the attack cannot be mapped. We present an innovative methodology based on non-optical analysis, namely identifying a group of volatile compounds and microclimate signs in forest stands that indicate stress factors in forest stands. An attacked tree by a bark beetle produces increased amounts of biogenic volatile organic compounds associated with defense, and the microclimate changes due to interrupted transpiration. In addition, the bark beetle uses the aggregation pheromone to attract more individuals and to attack the tree massively. In this study, we tested three electronic noses (Miniature Bosch sensor device with 25,419 samples, Sensory device for environmental applications with 193 samples, Handheld VOC Detector Tiger with 170 samples) in a freshly infested spruce stand. The measurement was conducted at ground level with the help of a human operator and was repeated six times to verify the detection capability of the electronic noses. To verify the capability of electronic noses to predict tree infestation, we used machine learning Random Forest. The results demonstrated that electronic noses can detect bark beetle infestation start (within 1 week of the first attack). The Miniature Bosch sensor device achieved the highest accuracy with a value of 95%, in distinguishing forest sections that are healthy and infested; the second most accurate electronic nose is the Sensory device for environmental applications, with an accuracy of 89%. Our proposed methodology could be used to detect bark beetle presence.

How ecosystem-level ET and its components may vary with canopy-tree mortality (treefall) and subsequent understory recovery remains unclear. Methods: We used 10 years of continuous eddy-covariance and remote-sensing data (2007–2016) and machine-learning models based on random forest and xgboost to determine forest- and climate-driven effects at temporal scales appropriate for a lodgepole pine-dominated stand following a major, five-year MPB disturbance initiated in the summer of 2006. Results: Total annual ET over the 10 years ranged from 207.2 to 384.6 mm, with annual plant transpiration (T) contributing to 57 ± 5.4% (mean ± standard deviation) of annual ET. Annual ET initially declined (2007–2011) and then increased (2011–2016), with ET and T/ET increasing at statistically non-significant rates of approximately 3.2 and 1.2% per year from 2007 to 2016. Air temperature (Ta) and vapor pressure deficit (VPD) were the most important predictors of seasonal variation in ET and T/ET during the 10-year period, with high Ta, VPD, and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) causing ET and T/ET to increase. Annual ET increased with both increasing spring Ta and decreasing VPD. Annual T/ET was shown to increase with increasing VPD and decrease with increasing volumetric soil water content at a 5-cm depth (VWC5). Enhanced vegetation index (EVI, an indicator of canopy greenness) lagged T and overstory tree mortality, whereas previous- and current-year values of EVI were shown to be poor predictors of annual ET and T/ET. Discussion and conclusions: These findings suggest that the promotion of climate factors on forest ecosystem-level water vapor fluxes may offset reductions promoted by MPB outbreaks. Climate processes affected water vapor fluxes more than biotic factors, like stand greenness, highlighting the need to include climate-regulatory mechanisms in predictive models of ET dynamics during and subsequent to stand disturbance. Climate and forest-greenness effects on water vapor fluxes need to be explored at even longer time scales, e.g., at decadal scales, to capture long-drawn-out trends associated with stand disturbance and its subsequent recovery.

This study explores the consistency of multiple evaporation reanalysis datasets across mainland China and fuses them with multi-model ensemble method. To address the uncertainty inherent in the traditional evapotranspiration stress index (ESI) that only considers the ETa and ETp relationship, we employ Pearson Correlation Analysis and a Random Forest-based Boruta Algorithm to propose new evapotranspiration stress proxies blending multiple remote sensing indicators, named as MESI-P and MESI-B, respectively. Then, we verified their performance in depicting vegetation production capacity based on Solar-Induced Chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF) and Gross Primary Productivity (GPP). New hydrological insights for the region: The patterns of ETa from GLDAS, GLEAM, and Harvard Dataverse in China show consistent, but their threshold values differ. The synthesized ETa obtained after using a multi-model ensemble (MME) method is more adaptable in China, with a range of 0.45–1485.31 mm and an increase of 11.34 mm/10a. Following the same pattern as GLDAS and CRU, the synthetic ETp experiences an increasing trend (11.24 mm/10a) during 2000–2019. Compared with the traditional ESI, the MESI-P and MESI-B proposed in this study have superior signal convergence with ETa, SIF, and GPP due to the higher correlation coefficients (＞0.95) in China. Furthermore, during the calculation of MESI-B, soil moisture and solar radiation are identified as dominate factor in Northwest and Southern China respectively. © 2024 The Authors",Actual evapotranspiration; Hydrological factors; Machine learning model; Multi-source remote sensing products; Potential evapotranspiration,,Yes,Yes,remote sensing,"climate & meteorology, vegetation indices, soil",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0

Deep learning (DL) models have shown excellent forecasting abilities for different HVs. However, most DL models typically predicted HVs independently, without satisfying the principle of water balance. This missed the interactions between different HVs in the hydrological system and the underlying physical rules. In this study, we developed a DL model based on multitask learning and hybrid physically constrained schemes to simultaneously forecast soil moisture, evapotranspiration, and runoff. The models were trained using ERA5-Land data, which have water budget closure. We thoroughly assessed the advantages of the multitask framework and the proposed constrained schemes. Results showed that multitask models with different loss-weighted strategies produced comparable or better performance compared to the single-task model. The multitask model with a scaling factor of 5 achieved the best among all multitask models and performed better than the single-task model over 70.5% of grids. In addition, the hybrid constrained scheme took advantage of both soft and hard constrained models, providing physically consistent predictions with better model performance. The hybrid constrained models performed the best among different constrained models in terms of both general and extreme performance. Moreover, the hybrid model was affected the least as the training data were artificially reduced, and provided better spatiotemporal extrapolation ability under different artificial prediction challenges. These findings suggest that the hybrid model provides better performance compared to previously reported constrained models when facing limited training data and extrapolation challenges. © 2023 American Meteorological Society.",Artificial intelligence; Deep learning; Forecasting techniques; Neural networks; Regression,artificial intelligence; artificial neural network; forecasting method; hydrological modeling; machine learning; regression analysis; water budget,Yes,Yes,weather station,"climate & meteorology, vegetation indices, soil",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0

The Penman-Monteith (PM) equation method, developed by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), represents an advancement over earlier approaches for estimating ETo. Eto though reliable, faces limitations due to the requirement for climatological data not always available at specific locations. To address this, researchers have explored soft computing (SC) models as alternatives to conventional methods, known for their exceptional accuracy across disciplines. This critical review aims to enhance understanding of cutting-edge SC frameworks for ETo estimation, highlighting advancements in evolutionary models, hybrid and ensemble approaches, and optimization strategies. Recent applications of SC in various climatic zones in Bangladesh are evaluated, with the order of preference being ANFIS > Bi-LSTM > RT > DENFIS > SVR-PSOGWO > PSO–HFS due to their consistently high accuracy (RMSE and R2). This review introduces a benchmark for incorporating evolutionary computation algorithms (EC) into ETo modeling. Each subsection addresses the strengths and weaknesses of known SC models, offering valuable insights. The review serves as a valuable resource for experienced water resource engineers and hydrologists, both domestically and internationally, providing comprehensive SC modeling studies for ETo forecasting. Furthermore, it provides an improved water resources monitoring and management plans. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",ANSIF; Bangladesh; Climate variability; Evapotranspiration prediction; Machine learning models,Agriculture; Algorithms; Bangladesh; Hydrology; Soft Computing; Bangladesh; Climate models; Long short-term memory; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Soft computing; Water supply; ANSIF; Bangladesh; Climate variability; Evapotranspiration prediction; Future prospects; Machine learning models; Non linear; Reference evapotranspiration; Soft computing models; Waters resources; climate change; evapotranspiration; machine learning; United Nations; water resource; algorithm; Article; Bangladesh; benchmarking; calculation; climate change; evapotranspiration; forecasting; fuzzy system; machine learning; support vector machine; water supply; agriculture; algorithm; hydrology; Evapotranspiration,Yes,Yes,empirical models,"climate & meteorology, vegetation indices",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0

The objective of this study is to explore the cotton LAI estimation models based on multi-spectral data from drones at different growth stages and multiple growth stages, clarify the variation patterns of cotton LAI estimation models during different growth stages, and to provide a basis for real-time understanding of cotton growth and scientific field management tailored to local conditions.【Method】The DJI Elf 4 multi-spectral UAV was used to acquire multi-spectral images and RGB images of cotton at budding stage, initial flowering stage, boll setting and open-boll stages. Five multi-spectral indices, namely normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized green difference vegetation index (GNDVI), normalized difference red-edge index (NDRE), leaf chlorophyll index (LCI), optimized soil adjusted vegetation index (OSAVI), and five color indices, namely modified green-red vegetation index (MGRVI), green-red vegetation index (GRVI), green leaf algorithm (GLA), excess red index (EXR), and visible atmospherically resistant vegetation index (VARI), were selected to build a data set for each growth stage of cotton and multiple growth stages of cotton growth, respectively. Combined with the punching method to obtain actual ground LAI data, the machine learning algorithms of partial least squares regression (PLSR), ridge regression (RR), random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM) and back propagation (BP) were used to construct a cotton LAI prediction model.【Result】The LAI of cotton exhibited an increasing and then decreasing pattern during the growth stage. Notably, the mean LAI values of cotton at the inner side of the budding stage, initial flowering stage, and boll setting stage were significantly greater than those at the lateral side (P＜0.05). The selected indices exhibited significant correlations with each other across the periods (P＜0.05). In general, the correlation between multi-spectral index and color index showed a decreasing trend as the growth stage progressed, and the selected indices were significantly correlated with cotton LAI in all stages (P＜0.05), the correlation coefficients of multi-spectral index ranged from 0.35 to 0.85, and the correlation coefficients of color index ranged from 0.49 to 0.71, and those with a larger absolute value of the correlation coefficients were mostly multi-spectral indices, while those of the correlation coefficients of color index and cotton LAI were smaller. The estimated model performance results showed that the multi-spectral index was better than the color index in the cotton growth models, the predictive performance of the index models showed certain regularity with the change of growth, and NDVI was the optimal index for predicting cotton LAI. From the model results, the RF model and BP model obtained higher estimation accuracy under each growth stage. The LAI inversion model at the initial flowering stage had the highest accuracy, with the optimal model validation set R2 of 0.809, MAE of 0.288, and NRMSE of 0.120. The optimal model validation set for the multiple growth stages had the R2 of 0.386, MAE of 0.700, and NRMSE of 0.198.【Conclusion】There are significant differences in LAI between the inner and lateral sides of cotton during the budding stage, initial flowering stage, and boll setting stage. NDVI emerged as the optimal index for predicting cotton LAI at all growth stages, with the RF and BP models demonstrating superior performance. The effectiveness of the multiple growth stages model was notably lower compared to that of the single-growth model, with the optimal index identified as GNDVI and the optimal model as BP. The initial flowering stage appeared to be the optimal window for predicting cotton LAI. These findings can provide theoretical basis and technical support for utilizing UAV remote sensing to monitor cotton LAI. © 2024 Editorial Department of Scientia Agricultura Sinica.

Upscaling instantaneous ET ((Formula presented.)) to daily ET ((Formula presented.)) is vital for thermal-based ET estimation. Conventional methods–such as the constant evaporative fraction method (ConEF), radiation-based method, and evaporative ratio method–often overlook environmental factors, leading to biased estimates of (Formula presented.) from (Formula presented.). To resolve this issue, this study aimed to assess four machine learning (ML) algorithms—XGBoost, LightGBM, AdaBoost, and Random Forest—to integrate meteorological and remote sensing data for upscaling (Formula presented.) across 88 global flux sites. Each ML model was tested with eight different variable combinations. Results indicated that XGBoost exhibited the best performance, with a root mean square error (RMSE) generally below 13 W (Formula presented.) in estimating (Formula presented.) from (Formula presented.). The best variable combination simultaneously considers evaporative fraction, available energy, meteorology factors, remote sensing albedo, normalized vegetation index, and leaf area index. Using this combination, the XGBoost model achieved an (Formula presented.) = 0.88 and an RMSE = 12.33 W (Formula presented.), outperforming the ConEF method ((Formula presented.) = 0.71 and RMSE = 18.86 W (Formula presented.)) and its expansions.

The FAO recommends coupling the Penman–Monteith (P-M) model with the Ångström–Prescott (A-P) formula as the standard method for ET0 estimation with missing Rs measurements. However, its application is usually restricted by the two fundamental coefficients (a and b) of the A-P formula. This paper proposes a new method for estimating ET0 with missing Rs by combining machine learning with physical-based P-M models (PM-ET0). The benchmark values of the A-P coefficients were first determined at the daily, monthly, and yearly scales, and further evaluated in Rs and ET0 estimates at 80 national Rs measuring stations. Then, three empirical models and four machine-learning methods were evaluated in estimating the A-P coefficients. Machine learning methods were also used to estimate ET0 (ML-ET0) to compare with the PM-ET0. Finally, the optimal estimation method was used to estimate the A-P coefficients for the 839 regular weather stations for ET0 estimation without Rs measurement for China. The results demonstrated a descending trend for coefficient a from northwest to southeast China, with larger values in cold seasons. However, coefficient b showed the opposite distribution as the coefficient a. The FAO has recommended a larger a but a smaller b for southeast China, which produced the region's largest Rs and ET0 estimation errors. Additionally, the A-P coefficients calibrated at the daily scale obtained the best estimation accuracy for both Rs and ET0, and slightly outperformed the monthly and yearly coefficients without significant difference in most cases. The machine learning methods outperformed the empirical methods for estimating the A-P coefficients, especially for the sites with extreme values. Further, ML-ET0 outperformed the PM-ET0 with yearly A-P coefficients but underperformed those with daily and monthly ones. This study indicates an exciting potential for combining machine learning with physical models for estimating ET0. However, we found that using the A-P coefficients with finer time scales is unnecessary to deal with the missing Rs measurements. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",global solar radiation; machine learning; penman–Monteith model; reference evapotranspiration; Ångström–Prescott formula,China; Evapotranspiration; Solar radiation; Water management; Angstrom–prescott formula; Global solar radiation; Machine learning methods; Machine-learning; On-machines; Penman-Monteith models; Reference crop evapotranspirations; Reference evapotranspiration; Solar radiation data; Waters managements; estimation method; evapotranspiration; machine learning; parameterization; solar radiation; water management; Machine learning,Yes,Yes,"weather station, empirical models",climate & meteorology,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0
426,Bringeland S.; Fotopoulos G.,Analysis of gap filling techniques for GRACE/GRACE-FO terrestrial water storage anomalies in Canada,2024,10.1016/j.jhydrol.2024.130644,"Terrestrial water storage anomaly (TWSA) data derived from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE/GRACE-FO) have become indispensable for hydrological monitoring since the first mission launched in 2002. Evaluation of basin dynamics is enabled through TWSA integration with independent hydrological and climate datasets such as precipitation, evapotranspiration, and surface runoff. With over 20 years of observations, long-term statistical analysis reveals water storage trends, provided the 11-month gap between the two missions is filled. This study compares four methods for reconstructing GRACE-like TWSA over Canada, namely: extreme gradient boosting, artificial neural networks, automated machine learning, and projection onto convex sets. The GRACE mascon product released by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory is used over the study region. Nine sets of hydrological and climate parameters are used as predictors for the machine learning models, namely GRACE average seasonal signals, TWSA from the GLDAS Catchment Land Surface Model, precipitation, air temperature, glacier surface mass balance, ocean tides, the North Atlantic Oscillation, the Multivariate ENSO Index, and sea surface temperature. For each of the four methods, 20 % of the GRACE TWSA data (the ‘testing data’) is omitted from the model training, and the model is used to fill the artificial gap. Root mean square error (RMSE) is computed using the difference between testing data and model predictions. Normalized RMSE expresses the RMSE as a proportion of the range of the GRACE TWSA data. The automated machine learning algorithm performs best in terms of mean normalized root mean square error, with 6 % (2.4 cm equivalent water height RMSE), followed by projection onto convex sets, extreme gradient boosting, and artificial neural networks. Inclusion of glacier surface mass balance models derived from the GMAO Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications Version 2 reanalysis and the Randolph Glacier Inventory improved the automated machine learning average root mean square error by 70 %. Results indicate that filling the gap between missions allows for more comprehensive analysis of terrestrial water storage changes, including basin-by-basin analysis, which is ongoing. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",GRACE; GRACE-FO; Hydrology; Machine learning; POCS; Terrestrial water storage anomaly,Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); Canada; Atmospheric pressure; Atmospheric temperature; Automation; Catchments; Climate models; Digital storage; Errors; Mean square error; Neural networks; Oceanography; Set theory; Surface waters; Automated machines; GRACE; GRACE-FO; Gradient boosting; Machine-learning; POCS; Projections onto convex sets; Root mean square errors; Terrestrial water storage; Terrestrial water storage anomaly; algorithm; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; error analysis; GRACE; hydrological modeling; machine learning; mass balance; water storage; Machine learning,Yes,Yes,Not Specified,"climate & meteorology, vegetation indices",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0

Accurate ETo prediction is crucial for optimizing irrigation water management. This research aimed to assess the reliability and accuracy of ML algorithms in predicting ETo values. Three ETo calculation methods were employed: Penman-Monteith (PM), Hargreaves (HA), and Blaney-Criddle (BC). The study analyzed ETo and other climate variables using the modified Mann-Kendall test (m-MK) and Theil Sen’s slope estimator methods to identify trends. Multiple ML algorithms, including Support Vector Regression (SVR), Random Forest (RF), XGboost, K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Decision Trees (DT), Linear Regression (LR), and Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) were utilized for ETo prediction. The ML algorithms exhibited excellent performance, with coefficients of determination (R2) values ranging from 0.97 to 0.99 for PM, 0.99 for HA, and from 0.91 to 0.92 for BC. The models demonstrated a high value of the Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE) with low Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) values. Strong correlations between the predicted and calculated daily ETo were observed with R2 values of 0.99, 0.99, and 0.92 for PM, HA, and BC methods, respectively. In conclusion, this study affirmed the accuracy and reliability of ML algorithms to match that of standard ETo prediction equations. © 2024 The Author(s).

The FAO-56 Penman-Monteith method is employed to analyze ET0, while the Modified Mann Kendall test is utilized to assess trends and Sen’s Slope Estimator is used for magnitude analysis. The future prediction is conducted using Support Vector Machine (SVM), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Random Forest (RF) models. Results show an increasing ET0 trend annually in the southeastern and northeastern zones, while decreased values are observed in other regions, particularly in the northwest (0.83 mm). Sen’s slope estimator reveals distinct fluctuations in ET0, with notable disparities in the Southeastern, Northeastern, Southwestern, and South-Central zones. Notably, Chattogram and Sitakunda experience an ET0 magnitude of 0.02 mm/Year, while other zones show a magnitude of 0.01 mm/Year. SVM outperformed other models, predicting rising ET0 in various seasons.

This study was conducted in Iran’s arid synoptic stations of Sirjan and Kerman, where data scarcity is severe. Penman–Monteith FAO-56 was selected as the target data for modeling artificial neural network (ANN), fuzzy neural adaptive inference system (ANFIS), and ANN-gray wolf optimization (ANN-GWO). The performance of these models was evaluated using an input dataset consisting of the current station’s minimum and maximum temperatures, ET0, and the wind speed of the nearby station (external data) in three different combinations. The models’ accuracy was assessed using two widely used criteria: root mean square error (RMSE) and coefficient of determination (R 2), as well as the empirical Hargreaves equation. In the absence of climatic data, the ANFIS, ANN, and ANN-GWO methods using minimum and maximum temperatures, which are relatively easier to estimate, outperformed the empirical Hargreaves equation method in both stations. The results demonstrate that the ANFIS method performed better than ANN and ANN-GWO in all three input combinations. All three methods showed improvement when external data (wind speed and ET0 of the adjacent station) were used. Ultimately, the ANFIS method using minimum and maximum temperatures and the adjacent station’s ET0 in Kerman and Sirjan yielded the best results, with an RMSE of 0.33 and 0.36, respectively. © 2023, The Author(s).",ANFIS; ANN; ANN-GWO; FAO Penman–Monteith; Neural-fuzzy,"Iran; Kerman [Iran]; Kerman [Iran]; Sirjan; Crops; Evapotranspiration; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy neural networks; Information management; Mean square error; Meteorology; Water management; Wind speed; (ANN), fuzzy neural adaptive inference system; Adaptive inference systems; Artificial neural network-GWO; FAO penman–monteith; Fuzzy-neural; Maximum temperature; Minimum temperatures; Neural fuzzy; Penman Monteith; Wind speed; agricultural application; arid region; artificial intelligence; artificial neural network; computer simulation; error analysis; estimation method; evapotranspiration; fuzzy mathematics; growth response; numerical model; optimization; temperature profile; water management; water resource; water use; wind velocity; Climate models",Yes,Yes,"weather station, empirical models",climate & meteorology,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

Nevertheless, due to the significant uncertainties in the inputs of conventional ETc equations and the inaccessibility of their proper spatial and temporal distribution values, precision agriculture requires a more accurate evaluation of ETc using efficient methods. Combining remote sensing (RS) data and machine learning (ML) techniques has provided a considerable capacity for estimating ETc, which can address these challenges. This study aims to develop a framework for ETc estimation based on the four most popular tree-based ML algorithms, namely M5-pruned (M5P), random forest regression (RFR), gradient-boosted regression trees (GBRT), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost). For this purpose, multisource RS data and meteorological and ground measurements (Meteo-GM) were used during three growing seasons (2018–2021) in irrigated croplands of the Sugarcane & By-Products Development Company in Khuzestan, southwest Iran. Since the unavailability of optical sensors, e.g., Landsat-8 data, in cloudy conditions restricts their enduring application, an alternative approach employing the Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data for ETc estimation was also proposed. A set of 23 scenarios of various unique combinations of the available parameters was developed to ensure that a proper decision could be made for ETc estimation under any conditions. Eventually, the contribution of the input variables to estimate ETc was evaluated using the Sobol sensitivity analysis. The results showed that the RFR algorithm provided the most accurate ETc estimation in all scenarios, followed by the XGBoost, GBRT, and M5P algorithms (R2 = 0.92–0.99, RMSE = 2.02–0.32 mm d-1). The Meteo-GM models’ performances were improved by incorporating optical and thermal infrared (TIR) (R2 = 0.99, RMSE = 0.32 mm d-1) and SAR (R2 = 0.98, RMSE = 0.65 mm d-1) RS data. In addition, Sobol's sensitivity analysis revealed that maximum temperature, wind speed, pan evaporation, leaf area index, moisture stress index, and inverse dual-pol diagonal distance were the most influential input variables in the ETc estimation. This study can be used as a reference to simplify the ETc calculations using a novel application of ML as a helpful basis for precision irrigation management from the point to the regional scale in any weather conditions. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",Crop evapotranspiration; Machine learning; Multisource remote sensing data; Random forest; Sobol analyze; XGBoost,Iran; Khuzestan; Crops; Evapotranspiration; Forestry; Optical remote sensing; Plants (botany); Random forests; Regression analysis; Sensitivity analysis; Synthetic aperture radar; Water management; Wind; Boosted regression trees; Crop evapotranspiration; Ground measurements; Machine-learning; Meteorological measurements; Multisource remote sensing data; Random forests; Remote sensing data; Sobol analyze; Xgboost; algorithm; evapotranspiration; irrigation system; leaf area index; machine learning; precision agriculture; remote sensing; resource management; satellite data; sensitivity analysis; sugar cane; temporal distribution; water resource; Machine learning,Yes,Yes,"weather station, remote sensing","climate & meteorology, vegetation indices",0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0

This study found a decreasing trend of 0.15 ppm-hrs/yr (p = 0.049) in W126 at a Yellowstone National Park monitoring site during 1997–2021 and no trend at a Grand Teton National Park site over 2012–2021 but no trends at both sites in POD calculated following the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution (CLRTAP) (2017). To evaluate the CLRTAP (2017) method, 2019 summer POD was calculated for comparison using the Big-leaf model and was found 20%–100% less than the CLRTAP (2017)-calculated leaf-level one already, let alone compared to the latter scaled up to canopy-level, owing to the much smaller stomatal O3 flux (SOF) estimates under most conditions. Further analysis revealed exceptions where larger SOF values (>0.02 mmol/m2/hr), obtained from using the Big-leaf model with measured sensible heat and water vapor flux included in input, were not captured by the CLRTAP (2017) method and the Big-leaf model with input of regular meteorological variables only. Those large SOF values resulted under cooler, less windy, more humid, and cloudier conditions, when the approximate water vapor concentration difference between the ambient and leaf saturation level was found <1 mol/m3. A multivariate function was developed, through machine learning, by regressing SOF on air temperature, wind speed, relative humidity, phytosynthetically active radiation, and O3 concentration. Its testing and evaluation demonstrated improved estimates of the large variability in SOF. This new parameterization showed promising capability of assessing critical levels of O3 exposure in park management, and it could be further improved with long-term flux measurement data becoming available and evapotranspiration better represented. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Dry deposition; Ozone; Stomatal conductance; Stomatal ozone flux,Air; Europe; Grand Teton National Park; Niger [West Africa]; United States; Wyoming; Yellowstone National Park; Air pollution; Ozone layer; Risk assessment; Water vapor; Wind; ozone; Condition; Critical level; Dry deposition; National Park Service; Ozone exposures; Plant species; Sensitive plants; Stomatal conductance; Stomatal ozone fluxes; Trans-boundary air pollutions; air quality; dry deposition; evapotranspiration; flux measurement; ozone; parameterization; pollution monitoring; stomatal conductance; water vapor; air pollution; air temperature; Article; canopy; dry deposition; Europe; evapotranspiration; heat; machine learning; national park; nonhuman; plant leaf; quantitative analysis; relative humidity; stomatal conductance; summer; United Nations; vegetation; water vapor; wind speed; Ozone,Yes,Yes,weather station,"climate & meteorology, vegetation indices, plant physiology",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1

This study developed a rapid workflow for sugarcane yield estimation by integrating remote sensing and meteorological datasets through machine learning (ML). The seven ML algorithms namely, “random forest (RF),” “support vector regression,” “decision tree (DT),” “K-nearest neighbors (KNN),” “XGBoost (XGB),” “Gradient boosting regression,” “ridge regression” and one “customized stack ensemble model” were used predict the sugarcane yield under two different datasets condition: integrated MODIS (Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer) data with meteorological data and standalone meteorological data. Monthly mean value of eight MODIS data products, including “NDVI (Normalized difference vegetation index),” “EVI (Enhanced vegetation index),” “GPP (Gross primary productivity),” “FPAR (Fraction of photosynthetically active radiation),” “LAI (Leaf area index),” “NDWI (Normalized difference water index),” “VCI (Vegetation condition index),” and “ET (Evapotranspiration),” were acquired over a 21 years period to be used as a feature in models. The classification accuracy of the sugarcane class was measured using the F1 score, which was 88.23%. The result revealed that alone meteorological data was not sufficient for accurate estimation of yield. However, a significant improvement in estimation accuracy was observed when meteorological data was integrated with MODIS data. Based on the accuracy metric, the stack ensemble model provided more prediction accuracy (RMSE of 2.01 t/ha) followed by XGB (RMSE of 3.81 t/ha), DT (RMSE of 4.36 t/ha), and RF (RMSE of 4.27 t/ha). Based on the feature important output provided by algorithms, features of FPAR, VCI, GPP, and Z41 (morning relative humidity) were found to be significant contributors to the prediction model.

Tropical rainforests are among the most diverse and complex terrestrial ecosystems, harbouring vast plant and animal species throughout their dense multistory canopy. They contribute substantially to global precipitation through their high ET. However, there is little information about ET influences at very small spatial scales under given climatic conditions. In a tropical rainforest on Sumatra, we studied the relationship between pixel-level ET as derived from high-resolution (~10 cm), near-surface thermography from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and canopy structure as derived from red–green–blue (RGB) image and three-dimensional (3D) point cloud analyses. The 16 derived potential predictors encompassed vegetation height, height variability, vegetation density and reflectance variables. Using regression models, several of the studied variables had a significant linear relationship with ET, but the explained variance was only marginal. However, applying a random forest algorithm including forward feature selection and target oriented cross validation explained substantial parts of the pixel-level variance in ET (R2 = 0.56–0.65), thus indicating multiple non-linear relationships with interactions among predictor variables. Therein, green leaf index, leaf area density and vegetation height were often the most important variables for the prediction outcome, but their sequence varied among the four study plots. Overall, combining canopy structure variables derived from RGB photogrammetry explained relatively large parts of spatial ET variations. Our study thus indicates the large potential of combining UAV-based thermography and photogrammetry techniques with machine learning approaches to better understand ET but also suggests that more work remains to be done in explaining ET patterns at very small spatial scales. © 2023 The Authors.

The complicated nature of the evapotranspiration process is illustrated in the amount of meteorological variables required to estimate ET0. Incomplete meteorological data is the most significant challenge that confronts ET0 estimation. For this reason, different machine learning techniques have been employed to predict ET0, but the complicated structures and architectures of many of them make ET0 estimation very difficult. For these challenges, ensemble learning techniques are frequently employed for estimating ET0, particularly when there is a shortage of meteorological data. This paper introduces a powerful super learner ensemble technique for ET0 estimation, where four machine learning models: Extra Tree Regressor, Support Vector Regressor, K-Nearest Neighbor and AdaBoost Regression represent the base learners and their outcomes used as training data for the meta learner. Overcoming the overfitting problem that affects most other ensemble methods is a significant advantage of this cross-validation theory-based approach. Super learner performances were compared with the base learners for their forecasting capabilities through different statistical standards, where the results revealed that the super learner has better accuracy than the base learners, where different combinations of variables have been used whereas Coefficient of Determination (R2) ranged from 0.9279 to 0.9994 and Mean Squared Error (MSE) ranged from 0.0026 to 0.3289 mm/day but for the base learners R2 ranged from 0.5592 to 0.9977, and MSE ranged from 0.0896 to 2.0118 mm/day therefore, super learner is highly recommended for ET0 prediction with limited meteorological data. © The Author(s) 2023.",AdaBoost regression (ADA); Cross-validation; Ensemble learning; Extra tree regressor (ETR); K-nearest neighbor (KNN); Reference evapotranspiration (ET<sub>0</sub>); Super learner; Support vector regressor (SVR),Adaptive boosting; Forecasting; Irrigation; Learning systems; Machine learning; Mean square error; Meteorology; Motion compensation; Nearest neighbor search; Water management; Adaboost regression; Cross validation; Ensemble learning; Extra tree regressor; Extra-trees; K-near neighbor; Nearest-neighbour; Reference evapotranspiration; Reference evapotranspiration (ET0); Super learner; Support vector regressor; ensemble forecasting; evapotranspiration; machine learning; prediction; regression analysis; Evapotranspiration,Yes,Yes,weather station,climate & meteorology,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

To address this limitation, we developed a new downscaling approach using predictors from regional and global hydrological models for a 15-year period (2002–2017) and tested it in the northern Great Artesian Basin, Australia. We used four different machine learning algorithms (support vector machine, partial least squares, gaussian process and random forest) to downscale the original GRACE estimate of 0.5° to a spatial grain size of 0.1° (global) and 0.05° (regional). This was based on precipitation, evapotranspiration and runoff estimates from the Famine Early Warning Systems Network Land Data Assimilation System (FLDAS) and Australian Water Outlook (AWO) hydrological models, respectively. The downscaled products were validated using 42 in-situ precipitation observations spread across the test region. We further evaluated which of the downscaled products best mimicked local-scale hydrology using a range of statistical metrics. Our results showed that regional hydrological models best characterized the dynamics of local scale hydrology (rainfall v. downscaled product), and the gaussian process regression algorithm made the best predictions for both models. The correlation coefficients for the raw values varied from 0.45 to 0.49 while that of the standardized values varied from 0.46 to 0.52 with the random forest model providing the best fitting for the regional-based products.

In this study, we developed random forests (RF) based on the measured amounts of whole-plant photosynthesis and transpiration to predict cherry tomato fruit yields in a commercial greenhouse in Japan. Whole-plant daily net photosynthesis (Photo) and daily transpiration (Trans) were measured by using a real-time photosynthesis and transpiration monitoring system. Variables of environmental conditions (Env), including daily solar irradiation, air temperature, and atmospheric water vapor deficit, were also measured in the greenhouse. Data with different 7 variable combinations (Env, Photo, Trans, Env+Photo, Env+Trans, Photo+Trans, Env+Photo+Trans) and different 21 timeframes (from 1 to 6 consecutive weeks in the past 6 weeks) were used to train models for predicting the yield for the subsequent week. RF models with the timeframes of 3 consecutive weeks until 2 weeks before the date of yield prediction (3W2) and 4W2 and variable combinations of Photo, Env+Photo, and Photo+Trans had relatively low normalized root mean square error (RMSE%; 9.8–10.3%). The model that had a timeframe 4W2 and variable combination Photo had the best accuracy (RMSE% = 9.8%).

The widely used Penman–Monteith equation (ASCE-PM) estimates ETr across various timescales using ground weather station data. However, discrepancies persist between estimated ETr and measured ETr obtained from weighing lysimeters (ETr-lys), particularly in advective environments. This study assessed different machine learning (ML) models in comparison to ASCE-PM for ETr estimation in highly advective conditions. Various variable combinations, representing both radiation and aerodynamic components, were organized for evaluation. Eleven datasets (DT) were created for the daily timescale, while seven were established for hourly and quarter-hourly timescales. ML models were optimized by a genetic algorithm (GA) and included support vector regression (GA-SVR), random forest (GA-RF), artificial neural networks (GA-ANN), and extreme learning machines (GA-ELM). Meteorological data and direct measurements of well-watered alfalfa grown under reference ET conditions obtained from weighing lysimeters and a nearby weather station in Bushland, Texas (1996–1998), were used for training and testing. Model performance was assessed using metrics such as root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), mean bias error (MBE), and coefficient of determination (R2). ASCE-PM consistently underestimated alfalfa ET across all timescales (above 7.5 mm/day, 0.6 mm/h, and 0.2 mm/h daily, hourly, and quarter-hourly, respectively). On hourly and quarter-hourly timescales, datasets predominantly composed of radiation components or a blend of radiation and aerodynamic components demonstrated superior performance. Conversely, datasets primarily composed of aerodynamic components exhibited enhanced performance on a daily timescale. Overall, GA-ELM outperformed the other models and was thus recommended for ETr estimation at all timescales. The findings emphasize the significance of ML models in accurately estimating ETr across varying temporal resolutions, crucial for effective water management, water resources, and agricultural planning. © 2023 by the authors.",advective environments; aerodynamic components; genetic algorithm; machine learning; radiation components; reference evapotranspiration,Bushland; Texas; United States; Aerodynamics; Errors; Forestry; Genetic algorithms; Learning algorithms; Lysimeters; Machine learning; Mean square error; Meteorology; Neural networks; Thermocouples; Water management; Weighing; Advective environment; Aerodynamic component; Condition; Machine learning models; Machine-learning; Penman-Monteith equations; Radiation component; Reference evapotranspiration; Time-scales; Weather stations; advection; aerodynamics; estimation method; evapotranspiration; genetic algorithm; machine learning; numerical model; optimization; Penman-Monteith equation; water resource; Evapotranspiration,Yes,Yes,"weather station, load cells, empirical models",climate & meteorology,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

In this study, we explored the temporal and spatial variability of α and its biotic and abiotic drivers leveraging observations from 163 global flux sites spanning diverse PFTs. The results showed that the mean annual α was 0.86 across all sites, with high α values predominantly located in humid regions and diminished values in arid locales. In terms of seasonality, the α showed similar fluctuation patterns in the Northern or Southern Hemispheres with lower values in local summer and higher ones in spring and autumn. The spatial variations in α were mainly caused by climatic factors while the temporal variations were mainly driven by seasonal vegetation change. Among all factors, vapor pressure deficit, air temperature, precipitation and shortwave radiation were significantly correlated with α. Among vegetation types, deciduous needleleaf forests had the highest α (1.1), and open shrublands had the lowest α (0.5). Leaf Area Index (LAI) and canopy height significantly affected α in forest site, with varying mechanisms across vegetation types. Combining the observed α and global meteorological datasets, we employed a machine learning (random forest) model to establish global α dataset.

Routinely, WUE is estimated by first predicting gross primary production (GPP) and evapotranspiration (ET) and then calculating WUE as the ratio of GPP to ET. However, this approach can lead to amplified errors in WUE estimates due to uncertainties in GPP and ET predictions. Here, we proposed a novel random forest (RF)-based WUE estimation model, referred to as the DRF model, which directly predicts WUE as the targeted variable to improve WUE estimation. The DRF model was trained using a combination of remote sensing (RS), meteorological reanalysis, and digital elevation model (DEM) datasets, along with in situ WUE observations at 261 global flux tower sites from the FLUXNET2015 and AmeriFlux FLUXNET datasets. Moreover, the DRF model was intercompared with the routine WUE estimation method using the RF model (the IRF model) as well as the widely used Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Penman-Monteith-Leuning version 2 (PMLv2) products in WUE estimation. Our results demonstrated that the DRF model well-reproduced 8-day in situ WUE, with the root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 1.07 g C kg-1 H2O, the coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.59, and the mean bias error (Bias) of 0.00 g C kg-1 H2O, and showed significant improvement over the IRF model with the RMSE of 1.20 g C kg-1 H2O, R2 of 0.50, and Bias of -0.09 g C kg-1 H2O. Moreover, the DRF model considerably outperformed the MODIS product (RMSE =1.93 g C kg-1 H2O, R2 =0.01$ , and Bias = -0.49$ g C kg-1 H2O) and the PMLv2 product (RMSE =1.70 g C kg-1 H2O, R2=0.22$ , and Bias =0.25 g C kg-1 H2O). Finally, the DRF model better captured seasonal fluctuations of in situ WUE than the other three models/products. Our study indicates that the DRF model is a promising alternative to routine WUE estimation methods and has the potential to produce more accurate global WUE estimates in future studies.  © 2024 IEEE.",Ecosystem water use efficiency (WUE); evapotranspiration (ET); gross primary production (GPP); machine learning (ML); remote sensing (RS),Budget control; Evapotranspiration; Forward error correction; Geological surveys; Radiometers; Random errors; Random forests; Stockpile surveys; Time difference of arrival; Ecosystem water use efficiency; Efficiency estimation; Evapotranspiration; Gross primary production; Machine learning; Machine-learning; Remote sensing; Remote-sensing; Water use efficiency; air-soil interaction; evapotranspiration; hydrological modeling; MODIS; Penman-Monteith equation; remote sensing; water use efficiency; Mean square error,Yes,Yes,"eddy covariance, weather station, remote sensing, empirical models","climate & meteorology, plant physiology",1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1

To our knowledge, this study was the first to map the mangrove canopy EWT using Sentinel-2 image at the reserve scale, aiming to explore three modeling strategies in retrieving mangrove canopy EWT, including machine learning models (Random Forest Regression (RFR) and Adaptive Boosting (Adaboost)), radiative transfer models (RTMs, PROSAIL-D and biophysical processor in Sentinel application platform) and hybrid models (PROSAIL-D + RFR and PROSAIL-D + Adaboost). We further investigated the impacts of four ecogeographical factors (species distribution, slope, elevation and distance to dam) on the spatial distribution of canopy EWT using Geodetector method. The results showed that Adaboost (R2 = 0.593, RMSE = 0.771 kg/m2 and RPIQ = 1.820), PROSAIL-D (R2 = 0.451, RMSE = 0.937 kg/m2 and RPIQ = 1.537) and PROSAIL-D + Adaboost (R2 = 0.501, RMSE = 0.890 kg/m2 and RPIQ = 0.887) was the optimal machine learning, RTM and hybrid model in retrieving mangrove canopy EWT, respectively. The red-edge3, NIR and SWIR bands of Sentinel-2 imagery were sensitive to canopy EWT. Moreover, Geodetector analysis demonstrated that species distribution had the most significant impact on canopy EWT, with the interaction between species and distance to dams contributing the most to the spatial difference of canopy EWT.

Data-oriented deep learning (DL) has been increasingly utilized to forecast hydrological variables over recent years. In this study, the ability of the widely-used DL methods, including long short-term memory (LSTM), bi-directional LSTM (BiLSTM), deep neural network (DNN), and deep belief network (DBN), on the estimation of actual daily ET over the heterogeneous surfaces, was investigated using four groups of experiments. Firstly, the influence of the different input variables on the above DL-based ET model over the various land cover types was explored and analyzed. The results showed that the DL-based ET model can accurately estimate the actual daily ET over the heterogeneous surfaces using a few key conventional observations, i.e., net radiation (Rn), relative humidity (RH), air temperature (Ta), and wind speed (u), as well as soil water content (SWC). However, the performance of the DL-based ET model varied from the different combinations of input variables. SWC was crucial to the estimation of ET, with RMSD decreased from 0.94 to 0.76 mm d−1 when SWC was added to the DL model. Then, the comparison of the four DL-based ET model performances was done. The minor difference in ET estimates was caused by the algorithm differences between LSTM, BiLSTM, DNN, and DBN. Based on the above work, a unified DL-based ET model over the heterogeneous surfaces was developed. The unified DL-based model improved the applicability of DL in ET estimation although it underperformed the separate DL-based model. Finally, the comparison of the performance of the TSEB model and DL method was done. Evaluated with the results of heterogeneous surface, the DL-based model had a better accuracy with a MAPE of 16 – 50%; while the TSEB model had a larger MAPE of 20 – 55%. The results of this research suggest that the DL-based ET model is a promising alternative for the simulation of the daily ET over the heterogeneous surfaces. © 2023 The Authors",Comparison of algorithm; Conventional observations; Data-oriented deep learning; Heihe River Basin; Soil water content; Unified DL-based model,Deep neural networks; Drought; Evapotranspiration; Soil moisture; Water management; Wind; Comparison of algorithm; Conventional observation; Daily evapotranspirations; Data-oriented deep learning; Evapotranspiration models; Heihe river basin; Heterogeneous surface; Learning Based Models; Soil water content; Unified deep learning-based model; air temperature; algorithm; estimation method; evapotranspiration; land cover; machine learning; net radiation; relative humidity; soil water; water content; Long short-term memory,Yes,Yes,Not Specified,climate & meteorology,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Improving global E estimates is necessary to improve our understanding of climate and its impact on available surface water resources. This work presents a methodology for deriving monthly corrections to global E datasets at 0.25 (Formula presented.) resolution. A principled approach is proposed to firstly use indirect information from the other water components to correct E estimates at the catchment level, and secondly to extend this sparse catchment-level information to global pixel-level corrections using machine learning (ML). Several E satellite products are available, each with its own errors (both random and systematic). Four such global E datasets are used to validate the proposed approach and highlight its ability to extract seasonal and regional systematic biases. The resulting E corrections are shown to accurately generalize WC closure constraints to unseen catchments. With an average deviation of 14% from the original E datasets, the proposed method achieves up to 20% WC residual reduction on the most favorable dataset. © 2023 by the authors.",machine learning; optimal interpolation; water cycle,Catchments; Evapotranspiration; Information use; Machine components; Random errors; Runoff; Systematic errors; % reductions; Average deviation; Global water cycle; Machine-learning; Optimal interpolation; Pixel level; Satellites products; Systematic bias; Water cycle; Machine learning,Yes,Yes,remote sensing,"climate & meteorology, vegetation indices",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0

In this study, six AML-based models were first constructed using the H2O-AML platform, from which an optimal (AML-OP) model was selected for estimating daily ETa at ecosystem scales. In addition, hybrid models were developed by combining the six AML models with surface conductance (Gs) inverted from the Penman-Monteith equation and an optimal (PM-OP) model was also selected. With 15 predictor variables as model inputs that were compiled from various data sources, the performances of those models for estimating daily ETa were evaluated using observed data from the FLUXNET2015 dataset. The results revealed that no models showed consistently low noise levels across different ecosystem types, making it necessary to use AML techniques for selecting ecosystem-specific models. Interestingly, the AML-OP models (root mean square error (RMSE) and symmetric mean absolute percentage error (SMAPE) were 0.16–0.31 mm d-1 and 9 %–36 % respectively) showed slightly better predictive results than the PM-OP models (RMSE and SMAPE were 0.23–0.36 mm d-1 and 15 %–68 % respectively), likely owing to model parameter uncertainties and tight constraints of physical models on application condition. Secondly, as ETa nonlinearly responds to environmental variables, model predictability under extreme weather (drought and heatwave) conditions was examined. The results showed that the prediction of the AML-OP and PM-OP models expectedly worsened (RMSE and SMAPE increased by 0.06–0.77 mm d-1 and −19 % to 79 %, respectively); however, the AML-OP model still outperformed the PM-OP model in most ecosystems, further underscoring the need to understand ETa regulation mechanisms under varying climatic conditions. Finally, the PM-OP models developed here provided better daily ETa estimates compared to other recently proposed hybrid models (RMSE reduced by 0.98–1.80 mm d-1). Both models can be better applied to wetlands that have been less frequently evaluated previously (RMSE reduction of 0.22 mm d-1 and 0.18 mm d-1 for the AML-OP and PM-OP models). © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",Actual evapotranspiration; Automatic machine learning; Data-driven; FLUXNET; Hybrid modeling; Terrestrial ecosystem,Ecosystems; Evapotranspiration; Mean square error; Uncertainty analysis; Actual evapotranspiration; Automatic machine learning; Automatic machines; Daily evapotranspirations; Data driven; FluxNet; Hybrid model; Machine-learning; Root mean square errors; Terrestrial ecosystems; automation; error analysis; estimation method; evapotranspiration; extreme event; machine learning; terrestrial ecosystem; Machine learning,Yes,Yes,empirical models,"climate & meteorology, vegetation indices",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0

To maintain a dynamic balance between freshwater supply and demand on the platform, we investigate the relationship between water consumption in hydroponic lettuce cultivation and meteorological conditions such as temperature, humidity, and solar radiation. The limitations of traditional evapotranspiration models like the FAO-PM model in practical hydroponic cultivation is highlighted and four machine learning algorithms, including Random Forest, Backpropagation Neural Network, Support Vector Regression, and N-BEATS, are developed to predict water consumption specifically for hydroponic cultivation.

ETo can generate large deficits in soil moisture and runoff in different regions and seasons, leading to uncertainties in drought warning systems. A novel multivariate variational mode decomposition integrated with a boosted regression tree (i.e., MVMD-BRT) is constructed to forecast daily ETo. Firstly, the correlation matrix based on cross-correlation was computed to investigate the significant input predictor lags of daily ETo. Secondly, the MVMD technique decomposes the significant input lags into signals called intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). Thirdly, the IMFs were then employed in the BRT to build the MVMD-BRT model for daily ETo forecasting. A comparative assessment of MVMD against multivariate empirical mode decomposition (MEMD) was also performed on the same lines to develop the MEMD-BRT model.

Its application in indoor automated phenotyping platforms is still limited and mainly focuses on differences in plant temperature between genotypes or treatments, instead of estimating stomatal conductance or transpiration rate. In this study, the transferability of commonly used thermography analysis protocols from the field to greenhouse phenotyping platforms was evaluated. In addition, the added value of combining thermal infrared (TIR) with hyperspectral imaging to monitor drought effects on plant transpiration rate (E) was evaluated. Results: The sensitivity of commonly used TIR indices to detect drought-induced and genotypic differences in water status was investigated in eight maize inbred lines in the automated phenotyping platform PHENOVISION. Indices that normalized plant temperature for vapor pressure deficit and/or air temperature at the time of imaging were most sensitive to drought and could detect genotypic differences in the plants’ water-use behavior. However, these indices were not strongly correlated to stomatal conductance and E. The canopy temperature depression index, the crop water stress index and the simplified stomatal conductance index were more suitable to monitor these traits, and were consequently used to develop empirical E prediction models by combining them with hyperspectral indices and/or environmental variables. Different modeling strategies were evaluated, including single index-based, machine learning and mechanistic models. Model comparison showed that combining multiple TIR indices in a random forest model can improve E prediction accuracy, and that the contribution of the hyperspectral data is limited when multiple indices are used. However, the empirical models trained on one genotype were not transferable to all eight inbred lines. Conclusion: Overall, this study demonstrates that existing TIR indices can be used to monitor drought stress and develop E prediction models in an indoor setup, as long as the indices normalize plant temperature for ambient air temperature or relative humidity. © 2023, The Author(s).",Automation; Drought; Hyperspectral; Imaging; Maize; Phenotyping; Thermography; Transpiration rate,,Yes,Yes,"remote sensing, phenotyping","climate & meteorology, plant physiology",0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1

Field based methods estimate point-wise ET accurately, but the challenge is in estimating ET over a region with high accuracies. Machine learning based approaches were taken to estimate ET over a large spatial scale using the Bowen Ratio Energy Balance (BREB) technique. The BREB method depends on terrestrial energy balance equations to estimate ET. Thus, remote sensing-based parameters representing variables in the energy balance equation, and vegetation index representing plant health conditions were used in the model. The study was conducted in the arid areas of the southwestern United States, where dense patches of Salt cedar consume water from the primary water source. The preliminary model used enhanced vegetation index (EVI), global horizontal irradiance (GHI), surface temperature (TS), and relative humidity (RH) as parameters. The k-nearest neighbor method consistently generated poor accuracies. When all the parameters were used, accuracies of the other models varied within 90–94%. When one predictor parameter was dropped, the best model produced accuracies between 90 to 93%, which dropped to 87–92% when a second variable was dropped. Random forest and support vector machine with radial kernel consistently produced the best predictive accuracies. © 2023 by the authors.",evapotranspiration; machine learning; remote sensing,Arid regions; Energy balance; Forestry; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Nearest neighbor search; Remote sensing; Support vector machines; Vegetation mapping; Water management; Accurate estimation; Bowen ratio energy balances; Energy balance equations; High-accuracy; Machine learning algorithms; Machine-learning; Point wise; Remote-sensing; Tamarix ramosissima; Waters managements; Evapotranspiration,Yes,Yes,remote sensing,"climate & meteorology, vegetation indices",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0

However, conventional direct measurement methods are often costly and complex, thereby limiting the widespread application of tree sap flow monitoring techniques. The concept of a Virtual Measurement Instrument (VMI) has emerged in response to this challenge by combining simple instruments with Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms to indirectly assess specific measurement objects. This study proposes a tree sap flow estimation method based on environmental factors and AI algorithms. Through the acquisition of environmental factor data and the integration of AI algorithms, we successfully achieved indirect measurement of tree sap flow. Accounting for the time lag response of the flow to environmental factors, we constructed the Magnolia denudata sap flow estimation model using the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Random Forest (RF), Backpropagation Neural Network (BPNN), and Long Short-Term Memory network (LSTM) algorithms. The research results showed that the LSTM model demonstrated greater reliability in predicting sap flow velocity, with R2 of 0.957, MAE of 0.189, MSE of 0.059, and RMSE of 0.243. The validation of the target tree yielded an R2 of 0.821 and an error rate of only 4.89% when applying the model.

Implementing irrigation plans that are tailored to the specific water requirements of crops can enhance crop yield and improve the quality of tomatoes. The mastery and prediction of transpiration rate (Tr) is of great significance for greenhouse crop water management. However, due to the influence of multiple environmental factors and the mutual coupling between environmental factors, it is challenging to construct accurate prediction models. This study focuses on greenhouse tomatoes and proposes a data-driven model configuration based on the Competitive adaptive reweighted sampling (CARS) algorithm, using greenhouse environmental sensors that collect six parameters, such as air temperature, relative humidity, solar radiation, substrate temperature, light intensity, and CO2 concentration. In response to the differences in crop transpiration changes at different growth stages and time stages, the t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) algorithm was used to identify three characteristic intervals: florescence stage, fruiting stage daytime, and fruiting stage night-time. Based on this, a greenhouse tomato Tr prediction model (CARS-CatBoost model) based on the CatBoost machine learning algorithm was constructed. The experimental verification shows that the coefficient of determination (R2) of the constructed CARS-CatBoost single model for the whole growth stage is 0.92, which is higher than the prediction accuracy of the traditional single crop coefficient model (R2 = 0.54). Among them, the prediction accuracy at night during the fruiting stage is the highest, and the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) drops to 0.427 g·m−2·h−1.

Meteorological variables (mean and maximum air temperature, average air humidity, average level of solar radiation, vapor pressure deficit, extraterrestrial solar radiation, and day number of the year) were used as input. The simulation used two calculation scenarios: data with and without average solar radiation. The performance of the different machine learning models was evaluated using the mean square error, root mean square error, coefficient of determination, and slope of regression forced through the origin between the measured and simulated ETo. The results demonstrated that the applied models were able to describe nonlinear relationships between weather parameters and evapotranspiration. The accuracy of evapotranspiration estimation depended on the type of input variables and the machine learning model used. The highest level of evapotranspiration prediction was obtained using the artificial neural networks model. Including solar radiation data in the calculations improved the quality of evapotranspiration prediction in all four models. In the absence of data on the actual solar radiation reaching the Earth's surface, it is advisable to supplement the input data with data on extraterrestrial solar radiation and the day number of the year.

This study investigated the use of machine learning (ML) methods for predicting these indicators over Sweden, spanning steep climate and land use gradients. Three data arrangement methods (multi-features, temporal, and spatial) were used and compared in combination with seven ML/deep learning (DL) models (random forest (RF), decision tree, multivariate linear regression, support vector regression, autoregressive integrated moving average (AMIRA), artificial neural network, and convolutional neural network). Seven investigated features, obtained from Google Earth Engine, were used in the ML/DL modeling (soil moisture, PDSI, precipitation, evapotranspiration, elevation, slope and soil texture). The temporal ARIMA model (found most suitable for local scale prediction) and the multi-features RF model (more suitable for national-scale prediction) emerged as best performing for soil moisture prediction (with MAE of 9.1 and 11.95, and R2 of 0.79 and 0.59, respectively).

Here, we proposed an automated machine-learning-assisted ensemble framework (AutoML-Ens) that attempts to resolve this challenge. Details of the methodology and workflow of AutoML-Ens were provided, and a prototype model was realized with the key strategy of mapping between the probabilities derived from the machine learning classifier and the dynamic weights assigned to the candidate ensemble members. Based on the newly proposed framework, its applications for two real-world examples (i.e., mapping global soil water retention parameters and estimating remotely sensed cropland evapotranspiration) were investigated and discussed. Results showed that compared to conventional ensemble approaches, AutoML-Ens was superior across the datasets (the training, testing, and overall datasets) and environmental gradients with improved performance metrics (e.g., coefficient of determination, Kling-Gupta efficiency, and root-mean-squared error). The better performance suggested the great potential of AutoML-Ens for improving quantification and reducing uncertainty in estimates due to its two unique features, i.e., assigning dynamic weights for candidate models and taking full advantage of AutoML-assisted workflow. In addition to the representative results, we also discussed the interpretational aspects of the used framework and its possible extensions.

However, even under such a data scarcity, the accurate estimates of ET values remain necessary for precise irrigation. So, the present study aims to: i) evaluate the performance of six hybrid machine learning (ML) models in estimating the monthly actual ET values under different agro-climatic conditions in China for seven provinces (Shandong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, Jiangxi, Hubei, and Henan), and ii) select the best-developed model based on statistical metrics and reduce errors between predicted and actual ET (AET) values. AET datasets were divided into 78% for model training (from 1958 to 2007) and the remaining was used for testing (from 2008 to 2021). Deep Neural Networks (DNN) was used as a standalone model at first then the stacking method was applied to integrate DNN with data-driven models such as Additive regression (AR), Random Forest (RF), Random Subspace (RSS), M5 Burned Tree (M5P) and Reduced Error Purning Tree (REPTree). Partial Auto-Correlation Function (PACF) was used for selection of the best lags inputs to the developed models. Results have revealed that DNN-based hybrid models held better performance than non-hybrid DNN models, such that the DNN-RF algorithm outperformed others during both training and testing stages, followed by DNN-RSS. This model has acquired the best values of every statistical measure [MAE (10.8, 12.9), RMSE (15.6, 17.4), RAE (31.9%, 41.4%), and RRSE (39.3%, 47.2%)] for training and testing, respectively. In contrast, the DNN model held the worst performance [MAE (14.9, 13.7), RMSE (20.1, 18.2), RAE (43.9%, 43.7%), and RRSE (50.6%, 49.3%)], for training and testing, respectively. Results from the study presented have revealed the capability of DNN-based hybrid models for long-term predictions of the AET values. Moreover, the DNN-RF model has been suggested as the most suitable model to improve future investigation for AET predictions, which could benefit the enhancement of the irrigation process and increase crop yield. © 2023",Actual evapotranspiration; Deep neural networks; Meta-heuristic models; Stacked hybridization; Sustainability,"China; Heuristics; Machine Learning; Neural Networks, Computer; Random Forest; China; Fujian; Henan; Hubei; Jiangsu; Jiangxi; Shandong; Zhejiang; Budget control; Climate models; Data integration; Evapotranspiration; Forecasting; Forestry; Heuristic algorithms; Optimization; Actual evapotranspiration; Climatic conditions; Data scarcity; Heuristic model; Hybridisation; Meta-heuristic model; Metaheuristic; Performance; Stacked hybridization; Training and testing; agrometeorology; algorithm; artificial neural network; climate change; climate modeling; complexity; evapotranspiration; forecasting method; heuristics; machine learning; sustainability; weather; article; autocorrelation; China; climate; deep neural network; evapotranspiration; forecasting; harvest; machine learning; metaheuristics; prediction; random forest; artificial neural network; China; heuristics; machine learning; Deep neural networks",Yes,Yes,Not Specified,climate & meteorology,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

The spatial heterogeneity of ET patterns poses a great challenge for regional ET estimation over heterogeneous landscapes. In this study, we proposed a framework for estimating ET through interactive detector for spatial associations (IDSA)-based machine learning (ML) approaches by combining data from remote sensing and four flux towers distributed in the Hai River Basin. The IDSA model was applied to explore individual and interactive determinants of ET over the Hai River Basin. In addition, the geographical regions of ET were determined according to the spatial heterogeneity. Then we simulated ET in each geographical region separately using three ML models, including random forest, gradient boosting decision tree, and Cubist. General ML models without considering spatial heterogeneity were used for comparison, and evaluations were conducted with the eddy covariance flux tower observations at the site scale, also with water balance ET at the basin scale. The results demonstrated that the spatial patterns of ET were difficult to be explained by individual environmental variables (64.9 %). The maximum interpretability was improved by about 11.2 % through the interaction of air temperature (T) and normalized different vegetation index (NDVI). The framework developed in this study had excellent performance with coefficient of determination (R2) ranging from 0.807 to 0.811, root mean square error (RMSE) ranging from 0.654 mm/day to 0.661 mm/day, and mean absolute error (MAE) ranging from 0.470 mm/day to 0.485 mm/day. It was superior to general ML models at the site and basin scales. Additionally, the ET simulated by IDSA-based ML models were in good agreement with the reference product, further illustrating its reliability.

However, because traditional ET0 estimation models often require a large number of meteorological parameters as input variables, their application potential is limited, especially when simulating arid and semiarid regions where meteorological data are lacking. Therefore, it is still very challenging to estimate ET0 at large scales in arid and semiarid areas. In this study, we first proposed a semi-mechanistic model for estimating ET0 by deriving the relationship between canopy conductance to water vapor (gw) and solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) based on Fick's law and the light use efficiency (LUE) model, combining theories on optimal stomatal behaviour. Second, the relationship between SIF × VPD0.5 (VPD0.5: 0.5-power of the vapor pressure deficit) and ET0 in the model was verified at the site scale. On this basis, the semi-mechanistic model was applied to three machine learning models to simulate ET0. Four statistical indicators, including the coefficient of determination (R2), root mean square error (RMSE), normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE), were used to verify the model performance and screen out the optimal model. Finally, the optimal model was compared with five traditional empirical models. The results showed that (1) the relationship between ET0 and the product of SIF and the 0.5-power vapor pressure deficit (SIF × VPD0.5) was closer than the relationship between ET0 and SIF at the site scale. (2) Compared to the case in which SIF was used as the only input variable, three machine learning models performed better when SIF was scaled using VPD0.5 as the input variable, and the random forest regression (RFR) model in which SIF × VPD0.5 was the input variable was the optimal model (ET0opt). (3) The total mean value of ET0 at 22 sites simulated by ET0opt is 15.46 mm/4 days. The total mean ET0 value for the 22 sites calculated by the five traditional empirical models vary from 10.70 mm/4 days to 20.96 mm/4 days, while our results were in this range and close to their mean value.

However, current SM products have limited access and do not meet the spatio-temporal scale and soil depth requirements in eco-hydrological research. Thus, this study constructs a random forest prediction model for SM at different depths by identifying driving factors and quantifying the correlation effect of vertical SM based on the international SM network dataset. Subsequently, the SMAP product is integrated into the model to expand SM from point scale to regional scale, yielding an SM data product with a suitable scale and continuous time and space. The results indicate that the correlation between precipitation and SM changes into the interaction between adjacent SM layers as the depth increases. The lag time of SM in the shallow surface layer (0-3 cm) to precipitation was 1 day, and there was no delay on the daily scale in the 3-20 cm layers of the three underlying surface types. The response time of 50 cm SM to 20 cm SM was 1–2 days in cropland and grassland and 2 days in forest. Slope, land use type, clay proportion, leaf area index, potential evapotranspiration, and land surface temperature were the key driving factors of SM in the Shandian River region. The random forest model established in this study demonstrated good prediction performance for SM at both site and regional scales.

This study explores the performance of PM equation and two machine learning models, namely SVM and XGB models, using NWP meteorological data modeled to predict daily reference evapotranspiration (ET0) from 77 ground meteorological stations within the Poyang Lake basin of China, for 2006-2019. These machine learning models were compared with PM equation by RMSE, R2, MAE, NRMSE, PBIAS, and NSE to evaluate the performance of the models. The study confirms the superiority of machine learning models in daily ET0 prediction. Among them, the SVM model has the most optimal performance in predicting ET0. In the NWP data, the accuracy of Tmax and Tmin is much higher than other meteorological factors, followed by Rs and VPD, while the accuracy of RH and WS is relatively low. In addition, the prediction accuracy of ET0 in the medium- and long-term decreases with the delay of advance time, and the rate of decrease slows down. The results provide a reference for predicting ET0 in a climate region similar to the Poyang Lake basin. © (2023), (Taiwan Joint Irrigation Associations).

In this study, the meteorological, agricultural, and hydrological droughts were modeled in the Wadi Ouahrane Basin using various machine learning (ML) models and standardized indices of rainfall, evapotranspiration, and runoff (SPI, SPEI, and SRI) at different times scales (1, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 24 months). The applied ML models were the linear support vector machine (SVM), quadratic SVM, cubic SVM, fine gaussian SVM, medium gaussian SVM, coarse Gaussian SVM, rational quadratic Gaussian process regression (GPR), squared exponential GPR, Matern 5/2 GPR, exponential GPR, bagged tree, and boosted tree. Moreover, the hybrid models acquired by combining these ML models with wavelet transform were evaluated. The performance of the models was analyzed using statistical criteria such as root mean square error, determination coefficient, and mean absolute error. As a result, wavelet-GPR models showed the most promising results in estimating SPI, SPEI, and SRI values. The values for SPI (R 2 of train: 0.393; and test: 0.351), SPEI (R 2 of train: 0.809; test: 0.746), and SRI (R 2 of train: 0.999; test: 0.808) indicate monthly time scale. Additionally, for the time periods of 3, 6, 9, 12, and 24 months, the predictions for SPI, SPEI, and SRI generally obtain R 2 of train 0.99 and test 0.95 values. Moreover, it was determined that wavelet-based ML models, established with inputs divided into three subcomponents with Daubechies mother wavelet, showed superior results than standalone ML models.

This study investigates whether upstream basin and climatological characteristics also contribute to such changes. Drawing upon the case study of 18 sites across Peninsular India, we employed Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) with two dam-related and five geophysical as well as climatological factors of upstream basins as predictors to determine key influencing causes. Pre- and post-dam flow duration curves were used to characterise changes in flow post dam construction. We considered periods with the least rainfall difference pre- and post-dam and eliminated rainfall’s effect on downstream hydrograph changes. Two additional machine learning feature extraction algorithms, such as SelectKBest with f_regression and mutual information score, were also deployed to identify the most influential driver of changes in the post-dam downstream hydrograph. The outcome of three separate methods provided a robust and unbiased result. The three methods agreed that while dams are the primary determinant of changes in the typical peak monsoon flow and overall flow variability, potential evapotranspiration and land use-soil-slope, represented by US Soil Conservation Service Curve Number (CN) of the upstream catchment, could also be key factors affecting changes in the post-dam flood peak. These findings highlight the importance of considering the geophysical and climatological characteristics of upstream catchments when assessing the impact of dam construction on downstream hydrology, and potentially aid in the placement, size, and operation of new and existing reservoirs. © 2023, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.",Basin characteristics; Flow Duration Curve; Flow Variability; Peninsular India; Post-dam downstream flow,India; basin analysis; climate conditions; dam construction; flow velocity; hydrograph; streamflow,Yes,Yes,Not Specified,climate & meteorology,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Several physical and mechanistic based models are deployed for the estimation of transpiration. However, these models may not accurately explain physiological interactions for greenhouse settings under CO2 enrichment. Thus, it is necessary to build site-specific and microclimate-targeted models that can accurately estimate transpiration and irrigation water requirements. In this work, a data-driven predictive model is proposed for the estimation of short-term transpiration (mmol/m2.s) for cucumber crops grown in greenhouses with CO2 enrichment. Three machine learning models were investigated for transpiration modelling and prediction: deep neural networks (DNN), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and support vector machine regression (SVR). These predictive models assimilate microclimate, physiological and hyperspectral features with high temporal and spatial resolutions. The results demonstrated the inclusion of hyperspectral-based vegetation indices significantly increased the performance of the three machine learning models in predicting transpiration. The XGBoost model outperformed the DNN and SVR models with higher R2 of 0.62 – 7.53%, lower RMSE and MAE values of 9.74 – 46.19 mmol/m2.s and 13.74 – 39.08 mmol/m2.s respectively with microclimate, physiological and hyperspectral based vegetation index inputs. Moreover, the time series prediction with different time steps improved the XGBoost model, achieving an R2 of up to 99.0%. The XGBoost proved to be the most efficient in predicting transpiration for cucumbers grown in greenhouses under CO2 enriched environments. © 2023 The Authors",Deep neural networks; Extreme gradient boosting; Greenhouse; Hyperspectral imaging; Precision irrigation; Support vector machines; Transpiration; Vegetation index,Adaptive boosting; Carbon dioxide; Deep neural networks; Forecasting; Greenhouses; Hyperspectral imaging; Irrigation; Learning systems; Physiological models; Physiology; Transpiration; Vegetation; Accurate prediction; Extreme gradient boosting; Gradient boosting; HyperSpectral; Machine learning models; Precision irrigation; Predictive models; Support vector machine regressions; Support vectors machine; Vegetation index; artificial neural network; carbon dioxide enrichment; imaging method; irrigation; machine learning; physiological response; prediction; spectral analysis; support vector machine; transpiration; vegetation index; Support vector machines,Yes,Yes,Not Specified,"climate & meteorology, vegetation indices, plant physiology",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1
544,Yang Q.; Liu L.; Zhou J.; Ghosh R.; Peng B.; Guan K.; Tang J.; Zhou W.; Kumar V.; Jin Z.,A flexible and efficient knowledge-guided machine learning data assimilation (KGML-DA) framework for agroecosystem prediction in the US Midwest,2023,10.1016/j.rse.2023.113880,"Process-based models are widely used to predict the agroecosystem dynamics, but such modeled results often contain considerable uncertainty due to the imperfect model structure, biased model parameters, and inaccurate or inaccessible model inputs. Data assimilation (DA) techniques are widely adopted to reduce prediction uncertainty by calibrating model parameters or dynamically updating the model state variables using observations. However, high computational cost, difficulties in mitigating model structural error, and low flexibility in framework development hinder its applications in large-scale agroecosystem predictions. In this study, we addressed these challenges by proposing a novel DA framework that integrates a Knowledge-Guided Machine Learning (KGML)-based surrogate with tensorized ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) and parallelized particle swarm optimization (PSO) to effectively assimilate historical and in-season multi-source remote sensing data. Specifically, we incorporate knowledge from a process-based model, ecosys, into a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)-based hierarchical neural network. The hierarchical architecture of KGML-DA mimics key processes of ecosys and builds a causal relationship between target variables. Using carbon budget quantification in the US Corn-Belt as a context, we evaluated KGML-DA's performance in predicting key processes of the carbon cycle at three agricultural sites (US-Ne1, US-Ne2, US-Ne3), along with county-level (627 counties) and 30-m pixel-level (Champaign County, IL) grain yield. The site experiments show that updating the upstream variable, e.g., gross primary production (GPP), improved the prediction of downstream variables such as ecosystem respiration, net ecosystem exchange, biomass, and leaf area index (LAI), with RMSE reductions ranging from 9.2% to 30.5% for corn and 4.8% to 24.6% for soybean. Uncertainty in downstream variables was automatically constrained after correcting the upstream variables, demonstrating the effectiveness of the causality linkages in the hierarchical surrogate. We found joint use of in-season GPP and evapotranspiration (ET) products along with historical GPP and surveyed yields achieved the best prediction for county-level yields, while assimilating in-season LAI observations benefitted the prediction in extreme years. Uncertainty and error analysis of regional yield estimation demonstrated that KGML-DA could reduce prediction error by 26.5% for corn and 36.2% for soybean. Remarkably, the GPU-based tensor operation design makes this DA framework more than 7000 times faster than the PB model with a High-Performance Computing system, indicating the high potential of the proposed framework for in-season, high-resolution agroecosystem predictions. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.",Agroecosystem; Carbon fluxes; Crop yield; Data assimilation; Knowledge-guided machine learning; U.S. Midwest,Champaign County [Illinois]; Illinois; Midwest; United States; Budget control; Carbon; Crops; Ecosystems; Knowledge based systems; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Recurrent neural networks; Remote sensing; Agro-ecosystems; Carbon fluxes; Crop yield; Data assimilation; Gross primary production; Knowledge-guided machine learning; Learning data; Machine-learning; Process-based modeling; US midwest; agricultural ecosystem; carbon budget; carbon cycle; carbon flux; crop yield; data assimilation; error analysis; evapotranspiration; Kalman filter; leaf area index; machine learning; optimization; remote sensing; Forecasting,Yes,Yes,remote sensing,"climate & meteorology, vegetation indices",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0

Accurate short-term ETo forecasts are indispensable for informed irrigation decisions by relevant departments and individuals. Four deep learning (DL) models, including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), Bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM), and Bidirectional GRU (Bi-GRU), as well as two calibrated empirical models (Hargreaves-Samani (HS) and reduced-set Penman–Monteith (RPM)), were used to evaluate the performance of the ETo forecast with a lead time of 1–7 d using temperature forecasts in different climates. The results reveal that the DL models and calibrated HS and RPM models exhibited comparable trends in the ETo forecasts for lead times of 1–7 d. Nonetheless, the DL models consistently outperformed the HS and RPM models across the diverse climatic regions in China. The DL models displayed an average root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) of less than 0.887 and 0.633 mm/d, respectively. Moreover, the mean correlation coefficient (R) and accuracy (ACC) exceeded 0.807% and 89.701%, respectively. Among the DL models, the LSTM model demonstrated slightly superior performance in short-term daily ETo forecasts in diverse climates. The LSTM model exhibited RMSE and MAE ranges of 0.563–0.875 mm/d and 0.418–0.626 mm/d, respectively, along with R and ACC ranges of 0.81–0.90 and 89.94–98.11%, respectively. Furthermore, even with an increase in lead time, the DL models continued to exhibit strong predictive capabilities, consistently surpassing the performance of the HS and RPM models. Overall, the trained DL models presented an exceptional ability to forecast the short-term daily ETo in various climatic regions of China. These models require only a few input variables and readily available data, making them highly advantageous for practical applications in ETo forecasting. Such models hold promise for significantly enhancing regional agricultural water-resource planning and management. © 2023 The Authors",China; Climate zones; Deep learning; Reference evapotranspiration forecast; Temperature forecasts,China; Climate models; Forecasting; Irrigation; Learning systems; Long short-term memory; Mean square error; China; Climate zone; Deep learning; Hargreaves; Learning models; Performance; Reduced sets; Reference evapotranspiration; Reference evapotranspiration forecast; Temperature forecasts; alfalfa; artificial intelligence; climate conditions; climate prediction; climatic region; correlation; evapotranspiration; forecasting method; performance assessment; temperature effect; weather forecasting; Evapotranspiration,Yes,Yes,empirical models,climate & meteorology,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

However, drought susceptibility must be measured and predicted in a systematic way, especially in light of potential climate change scenarios. This study aimed to predict current and future drought susceptibility in Bangladesh using historical climate data (1991–2020) and coupled model intercomparison project 6 data for three seasons: pre-monsoon, monsoon, and post-monsoon. We applied an advanced machine-learning algorithm of artificial neural network (ANN) with a genetic algorithm (GA) optimizer to predict drought-prone areas. Nine hydrological parameters–rainfall, temperature, humidity, cloud coverage, wind speed, sunshine, potential evapotranspiration, and solar radiation–were used to develop drought susceptibility maps. Receiver operating characteristic curves and statistical metrics were used to validate the models. The results of a multilayer perceptron ANN coupled with a GA-based optimizer showed that the relevant statistical measures for training and testing datasets were the root mean square error (RMSE = 0.127 and 0.160) and coefficient of determination (R2 = 0.967 and 0.949) for the pre-monsoon season, monsoon season (RMSE = 0.023 and 0.035; R2 = 0.998 and 0.997), and post-monsoon season (RMSE = 0.083 and 0.142; R2 = 0.986 and 0.959), respectively. Further, drought-prone areas in the baseline drought period of 2020 for pre-monsoon season represented 23.86%, 14.24%, 12.85%, 29.92%, and 19.13% of the total area, respectively; similarly, for monsoon corresponding values were 1.83%, 44.18%, 4.99%, 8.76%, and 40.24%; and for post-monsoon drought they were 24.43%, 20.94%, 16.04%, 37.79%, and 0.80% of the total landmass of Bangladesh.

However, obtaining such products in regions with complex terrain and limited observation conditions is a challenging task. To address this issue, a statistical downscaling model for satellite precipitation products using an optimized Back Propagation (BP) neural network was developed. The model employed key environmental variables selected by the Mean Impact Value (MIV) index, including enhanced vegetation (EVI), land surface temperature (LST_D, LST_N), evapotranspiration (ET), digital elevation model (DEM), slope, and latitude and longitude (Lon, Lat). The downscaled precipitation products were corrected twice using a combination of the model error correction and observation data merging methods. Finally, the satellite precipitation products with a resolution of 0.1° (∼10 km) were downscaled to 1 km. A comprehensive evaluation of the results showed that: (1) the accuracy of the precipitation products obtained using this method was better than that of the original satellite precipitation products; (2) the method effectively supplemented precipitation data in areas with few ground stations, with better results in areas with a dense distribution of ground stations; (3) this method demonstrated the efficacy of satellite precipitation products for downscaling in areas with complex terrain. © 2023 COSPAR",Complex terrain; Downscaling; Machine learning; Meteorological satellite; Precipitation products,Backpropagation; Complex networks; Landforms; Learning systems; Satellites; Surveying; Complex terrains; Down-scaling; Ground stations; Limited observations; Machine learning methods; Machine-learning; Observation area; On-machines; Precipitation products; Satellite precipitation products; Error correction,Yes,Yes,"weather station, remote sensing","climate & meteorology, vegetation indices",0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0

This study conducted an extensive assessment of meteorological drought in northern Bangladesh, employing remote sensing indices and machine learning techniques. The main aim was to evaluate meteorological drought occurrences in northern Bangladesh from 2010 to 2019, utilizing seven drought parameters and a machine learning model. Utilizing a Random Forest (RF) model, this study employed the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) as the dependent variable and seven remote sensing indices as independent variables. Through this methodology, the study assessed the significance of these indices generated by the model and integrated them, culminating in the creation of a meteorological drought distribution map spanning 2010 to 2019. This approach offers novel insights by probing the interplay and collective impacts of these indices, shedding light on previously unexplored aspects of regional drought patterns of northern Bangladesh. The major findings showed that precipitation strongly influenced both short-term and long-term meteorological drought episodes. Moreover, land surface-related indices, such as Evapotranspiration (ET) and Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), exhibited a more pronounced impact on short-term drought occurrences, while vegetation-related indices like Normalized Multi-band Drought Index (NMDI) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) demonstrated greater influence over long-term drought events. During this timeframe, the Rajshahi division experienced frequent extreme and severe drought events. Moderate droughts and abnormally dry conditions were widespread. The Barind tract area consistently faced moderate to extreme droughts, with exceptions in 2011, 2014, and 2019. On average, over 5% of the region had extreme droughts, while more than 12% experienced severe droughts during this decade. Long-term drought indicators (SPI 6 and SPI 9) consistently showed higher frequencies of extreme and severe droughts compared to short-term indicators (SPI 1 and SPI 3), emphasizing the influence of prolonged rainfall deficits on extreme droughts and the relevance of longer time frames for severe drought dynamics. The RF model demonstrated strong performance with accuracy ranging from 81% to 95%. Low prediction errors (RMSE 6% to 31%) and high out-of-bag (OOB) accuracy ranging from 76% to 98% highlighted its accuracy. The F1 score consistently exceeded 76%, indicating high precision and recall. Cross-validation values ranged from 78% to 94%, affirming reliable generalization to new data. Incorporating the main findings, this study contributes valuable insights for the formulation of targeted drought mitigation strategies in northern Bangladesh. It is imperative to note that the scope of this study is confined to the northern region of Bangladesh, and generalizing these findings to other regions should be exercised with caution. Nevertheless, the research methodology and approach can serve as a model for future studies in related fields, advancing knowledge of how to assess droughts using remote sensing and machine learning methods. © 2023 The Author(s)",Drought assessment; Machine learning; Meteorological drought; Northern Bangladesh; Random Forest; Remote sensing,Bangladesh; Barind; Rajshahi; Drought; Forestry; Machine learning; Stream flow; Vegetation; Water resources; Bangladesh; Drought assessment; Machine-learning; Meteorological drought; Northern bangladesh; Random forest modeling; Random forests; Remote sensing index; Remote-sensing; Standardized precipitation index; accuracy assessment; assessment method; drought; machine learning; NDVI; precipitation (climatology); precision; remote sensing; water resource; Remote sensing,Yes,Yes,"weather station, remote sensing","climate & meteorology, vegetation indices",0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0

However, these forecasts still have very limited skill at the monthly time scale; hence, this study explores the possibilities for improving forecasts through different pre-and postprocessing techniques at the interface with a Precipitationn–Runoff–Evapotranspiration Hydrological Response Unit Model (PREVAH). Specifically, this research aims to assess the benefit of European weather regime (WR) data within a hybrid forecasting setup, a combination of a traditional hydrological model and a machine learning (ML) algorithm, to improve the performance of subseasonal hydrometeorological forecasts in Switzerland. The WR data contain information about the large-scale atmospheric circulation in the North Atlantic–European region, and thus allow the hydrological model to exploit potential flow-dependent predictability. Four hydrological variables are investigated: total runoff, baseflow, soil moisture, and snowmelt. The improvements in the forecasts achieved with the pre-and postprocessing techniques vary with catchments, lead times, and variables. Adding WR data has clear benefits, but these benefits are not consistent across the study area or among the variables. The usefulness of WR data is generally observed for longer lead times, e.g., beyond the third week. Furthermore, a multimodel approach is applied to determine the “best practice” for each catchment and improve forecast skill over the entire study area. This study highlights the potential and limitations of using WR information to improve subseasonal hydrometeorological forecasts in a hybrid forecasting system in an operational mode. © 2023 American Meteorological Society.",Climate classification/regimes; Ensembles; Hydrology; Machine learning; Operational forecasting,Switzerland; climate variation; ensemble forecasting; forecasting method; hydrological modeling; machine learning; runoff,Yes,Yes,weather station,"climate & meteorology, soil",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0

In this study, we compared a machine learning algorithm–support vector machine (SVM) and an analytical solution (Todorovic, 1999) for estimating canopy resistances. Then, these estimated canopy resistances were applied to the P–M equation for estimating ET; as a benchmark, a constant (fixed) canopy resistance was also adopted for ET estimations. ET data were measured using the eddy-covariance method above three sites: a grassland (south Ireland), Cypress forest (north Taiwan), and Cryptomeria forest (central Taiwan) were used to test the accuracy of the above two methods. The observed canopy resistance was derived from rearranging the P–M equation. From the measurements, the average canopy resistances for the grassland, Cypress forest, and Cryptomeria forest were 163, 346, and 321 (s/m), respectively. Our results show that both methods tend to reproduce canopy resistances within a certain range of intervals. In general, the SVM model performs better, and the analytical solution systematically underestimates the canopy resistances and leads to an overestimation of evapotranspiration. It is found that the analytical solution is only suitable for low canopy resistance (less than 100 s/m) conditions. © 2023 by the authors.",canopy resistance; evapotranspiration; Penman–Monteith equation; support vector machine; Todorovic’s method,Ireland; Taiwan; Evapotranspiration; Forestry; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Analytical approach; Canopy resistance; Cypress forest; Keys parameters; Machine learning algorithms; Machine learning approaches; Penman-Monteith equations; S-method; Support vectors machine; Todorovic’s method; algorithm; canopy architecture; estimation method; evapotranspiration; forest canopy; grassland; support vector machine; Support vector machines,Yes,Yes,empirical models,climate & meteorology,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

Although several methods have been developed to model ETo, a reliable method that can use limited climatic input parameters for data-limited regions is still limited. This study evaluated four machine learning (ML) methods: M5 pruned (M5P) tree, sequential minimal optimization (SMO), radial basis function neural regression (RBFNreg) and multilinear regression (MLR). The major objective of this study was to identify the best approach to estimate ETo with minimum input data in five stations (Multan, Jacobabad, Faisalabad, Islamabad and Skardu) located in Pakistan. The datasets of these stations comprised maximum and minimum temperatures (Tmax, Tmin), average relative humidity (RHavg), average wind speed (Ux), and sunshine hours (n) variables. Two scenarios were used for ETo modelling. In the first scenario, five climatic variables were used as inputs to estimate ETo as obtaining full climatic parameters is the biggest challenge in developing countries. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used as a clustering technique in the second scenario to reduce the climatic input parameters. The PCA results indicated that Tmax, Tmin and n were identified as effective inputs for ETo estimation. Based on statistical indicators, the M5P tree outperformed the other applied ML methods in estimating ETo under various climatic environments.

The recommended techniques for areas with insufficient measurements are based solely on daily temperature readings. Various ML methods were tested to evaluate how sophisticated an ML algorithm is for this task necessary. The main emphasis was on feature engineering, which involves converting raw variables into inputs better suited for ML algorithms, resulting in improved results. FE methods for estimating evapotranspiration include approximations of clear-sky solar radiation based on altitude and Julian day, approximate relative humidity and wind velocity, a categorical month variable, and variables interactions. The authors confirmed that the ability of ML in such tasks is not solely dependent on choosing the suitable algorithm but also on this frequently ignored step. The results of computational experiments are presented, accompanied by a comparison of the proposed method against standard ETo empiric equations. Machine learning methods, mainly due to the transformation of raw variables using FE, provided better results than traditional empirical methods and sophisticated ML algorithms without FE. In addition, the authors tested the applicability of the developed models in the broader area to evaluate the possibility of their generalizability. The potential of this approach to deliver improved predictions, reduced input requirements, and increased efficiency holds interesting promise for optimizing water management strategies, irrigation planning, and decision-making within the agricultural sector.  © 2023 Barbora Považanová et al., published by Sciendo.",Feature engineering.; Input data reduction; Machine learning; Reference evapotranspiration,Decision making; Evapotranspiration; Water management; Engineering learning; Engineering techniques; Feature engineering.; Feature engineerings; Input data reduction; Input datas; Machine learning algorithms; Machine learning methods; Machine-learning; Reference evapotranspiration; algorithm; evapotranspiration; machine learning; management practice; recreational management; relative humidity; solar radiation; wind velocity; Machine learning,Yes,Yes,empirical models,climate & meteorology,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

Tempranillo, influenced by a typical Mediterranean climate. The standard approach of using the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) crop evapotranspiration under standard conditions (FAO-56 Kc-ET0) to estimate ETc act for irrigation purposes faces limitations in row-based, sparse, and drip irrigated crops with large, exposed soil areas, due to data requirements and potential shortcomings. One significant challenge is the accurate estimation of the basal crop coefficient (Kcb), which can be influenced by incorrect estimations of the effective transpiring leaf area and surface resistance. The research results demonstrate that the tested MLAs can accurately estimate ETc act for the vineyard with minimal errors. The Root-Mean-Square Error (RMSE) values were found to be in the range of 0.019 to 0.030 mm·h⁻¹. Additionally, the obtained MLAs reduced data requirements, which suggests their feasibility to be used to optimize sustainable irrigation management in vineyards and other row crops. The positive outcomes of the study highlight the potential advantages of employing MLAs for precise and efficient estimation of crop evapotranspiration, leading to improved water management practices in vineyards. This could promote the adoption of more sustainable and resource-efficient irrigation strategies, particularly in regions with Mediterranean climates. © 2023 by the authors.",actual crop evapotranspiration; decision support systems; grapevine; machine learning algorithms; vineyard irrigation,,Yes,Yes,empirical models,climate & meteorology,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

A new multi-decomposition deep learning-based technique is proposed in this study to forecast weekly reference evapotranspiration (ETo) in western coastal regions of Australia (Redcliffe and Gold Coast). The time-varying filter-based empirical mode decomposition (TVF-EMD) technique was used to first break down the original meteorological variables/signals into intrinsic mode decomposition functions (IMFs), which included maximum and minimum temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and solar radiation. Using a partial autocorrelation function (PACF), the significant lagged values were then calculated from the decomposed sub-sequences (i.e., IMFs). A novel Extra Tree- Boruta feature selection algorithm was used to extract important features from the decomposed IMFs. Four machine learning approaches, including bidirectional recurrent neural network (Bi-RNN), multi-layer perceptron neural network (MLP), random forest (RF), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), were used to forecast weekly evapotranspiration using the TVF-EMD-based decomposed meteorological data. Different statistical metrics were applied to evaluate the model performances. The results showed that the decomposition of the input data by TVF-EMD significantly improved the accuracy compared with the non-decomposed inputs (single models without decomposition). The findings indicate that the TVF-BiRNN model, as presented, achieved the highest level of accuracy in simulating weekly ET0 at both the Redcliffe and Gold Coast stations (Redcliffe: R=0.9281, RMSE=3.8793 mm/week, MAPE = 9.2010%; Gold Coast: R=0.8717, RMSE=4.1169 mm/week, MAPE = 11.5408%). The novel hybrid modeling technique can potentially improve agricultural water management through its ability to generate more accurate ETo estimates weekly.

Climate change is a growing challenge for the agricultural sector and may threaten grasslands. To address these challenges, it is vital to conduct in-depth climate studies to understand the vulnerability of grasslands. In this study, machine learning was used to build an advanced model able to evaluate the future impact of climate change on grassland vigour. The objective was to identify the most vulnerable grassland areas, analyse the interaction between climate and grassland performance, and outline management strategies against the detrimental implications of climate change. A Random Forest (RF) regression was used to model the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) using the Standardised Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI). The model explained 76% of the NDVI variability. The foremost significant predictors of grassland vigour are the SPEI with temporal lags of 1, 4, and 12 months. These findings suggest that the vegetative status of grasslands exhibits high sensitivity to short-term drought while also being influenced by the memory of past climatic events over longer periods. Future projections indicate an overall reduction in grassland vigour, mostly in RCP8.5. The results indicate that negative effects will be more pronounced in mountainous regions, which currently host the most vigorous grasslands. Dry lowlands in the north should continue to have the lowest vigour in the future. A substantial reduction in vigour is expected in autumn, with an effect on grassland phenology. The development of grasslands in winter, favoured by increasing temperatures and precipitation, can advance the harvesting of grassland (cutting) and the grazing of livestock. To ensure that vigour is maintained in less favourable zones, adaptation measures will be needed, as well as more efficient management of highlands to provide an adequate level of production. © 2023 by the authors.",climate change; grasslands vigour; machine learning; normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI); random forest; standardised precipitation and evaporation index (SPEI),Portugal; agricultural land; biodiversity; climate change; climate effect; farming system; food security; grassland; livestock; machine learning; NDVI,Yes,Yes,Not Specified,"climate & meteorology, vegetation indices",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0

Leaves are related to crop photosynthesis, transpiration, and nutrient uptake. Traditional blade parameter measurements were labor-intensive and time-consuming. Therefore, based on the phenotypic features extracted from RGB images, it is essential to choose the best model for soybean leaf parameter estimation. This research was carried out to speed up the breeding procedure and provide a novel technique for precisely estimating soybean leaf parameters. Results: The findings demonstrate that using an Unet neural network, the IOU, PA, and Recall values for soybean image segmentation can achieve 0.98, 0.99, and 0.98, respectively. Overall, the average testing prediction accuracy (ATPA) of the three regression models is Random forest > Cat Boost > Simple nonlinear regression. The Random forest ATPAs for leaf number (LN), leaf fresh weight (LFW), and leaf area index (LAI) reached 73.45%, 74.96%, and 85.09%, respectively, which were 6.93%, 3.98%, and 8.01%, respectively, higher than those of the optimal Cat Boost model and 18.78%, 19.08%, and 10.88%, respectively, higher than those of the optimal SNR model. Conclusion: The results show that the Unet neural network can separate soybeans accurately from an RGB image. The Random forest model has a strong ability for generalization and high accuracy for the estimation of leaf parameters.

An accurate and reliable forecast of ETo facilitates effective decision-making in agriculture. Although numerous studies assessed various methodologies for ETo forecasting, an in-depth multi-dimensional analysis evaluating different aspects of these methodologies is missing. This study systematically evaluates the complexity, computational cost, data efficiency, and accuracy of ten models that have been used or could potentially be used for ETo forecasting. These models range from well-known statistical forecasting models like seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) to state-of-the-art deep learning (DL) algorithms like temporal fusion transformer (TFT). This study categorizes monthly ETo time series from 107 weather stations across California according to their length to better understand the forecasting models' data efficiency. Moreover, two forecasting strategies (i.e., recursive and multi-input multi-output) are employed for machine learning and DL models, and forecasts are assessed for different multi-step horizons. Our findings show that statistical forecasting models like Holt-Winters' exponential smoothing perform almost as well as complex DL models. Unlike statistical models, DL models generally suffer from low data efficiency and perform well only when enough data is available. Importantly, although the computational costs of most DL models are higher than statistical methods, this is not the case for all. Considering computational cost, data efficiency, and forecasting accuracy, our findings point to the superiority of the neural basis expansion analysis for interpretable time series forecasting (N-BEATS) architecture for univariate ETo time series forecasting. Moreover, our results suggest Holt-Winters and Theta methods outperform SARIMA – the most employed statistical model for ETo forecasting in the literature – in accuracy and efficiency. © 2023",Computational Cost; Data Efficiency; Deep Learning; Prediction Accuracy; Reference Evapotranspiration; Time Series Forecasting,California; United States; Agriculture; Cost benefit analysis; Decision making; Deep learning; Evapotranspiration; Forecasting; Information management; Learning systems; MIMO systems; Time series; Time series analysis; Computational costs; Cost data; Data efficiency; Deep learning; Forecasting models; Learning models; Prediction accuracy; Reference evapotranspiration; Statistical forecasting; Time series forecasting; algorithm; data quality; evapotranspiration; irrigation; machine learning; planning method; resource management; time series analysis; Efficiency,Yes,Yes,weather station,climate & meteorology,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

The statistical analyses of remote sensing climate variables (i.e., evapotranspiration, specific humidity, soil temperature, air temperature, precipitation, soil moisture) and remote sensing and ground-truth lake level applied to the period 1993–2012 reveal that remote sensing data has a skewed distribution; ground-truth data has a symmetrical distribution. Linear Regression (LR), Support Vector Regression (SVR), Regression Tree (RT), Random Forest Regression (RF), and Deep Learning (DL) methods show that (i) RF and LR, with the highest R2 and EVS and least MAE, MSE, RMSE and, CVMSE values seem the best models to further investigate remote sensing and ground-truth lake level data and (ii) the remote sensing data based models outperform the ground-truth data based models based on their MAE, MSE, RMSE, and CVMSE values.

Considering that the transpiration of vegetation at night is minimal and can be negligible, we established a machine learning model (i.e., extreme gradient boosting algorithm (XGBoost)) for soil evaporation estimation based on night-time evapotranspiration observation data from eddy covariance towers, remote sensing data, and meteorological reanalysis data. Daytime T was consequently calculated as the difference between the total evapotranspiration and predicted daytime soil evaporation. The soil evaporation estimation model was validated based on the remaining night-time ET data (i.e., model test dataset), the non-growing season ET data of the natural ecosystem, and ET data during the fallow periods of croplands. The validation results showed that XGBoost had a better performance in E estimation, with the average overall accuracy of NSE 0.657, R 0.806, and RMSE 11.344 W/m2. The average annual T/ET of the examined ten ecosystems was 0.50 ± 0.08, with the highest value in deciduous broadleaf forests (0.68 ± 0.11), followed by mixed forests (0.61 ± 0.04), and the lowest in croplands (0.40 ± 0.08). We further examined the impact of the leaf area index (LAI) and vapor pressure deficit (VPD) on the variation in T/ET. Overall, at the interannual scale, LAI contributed 28% to the T/ET variation, while VPD had a small (5%) influence. On a seasonal scale, LAI also exerted a stronger impact (1~90%) on T/ET compared to VPD (1~77%). Our study suggests that the XGBoost machine learning model has good performance in ET partitioning, and this method is mainly data-driven without prior knowledge, which may provide a simple and valuable method in global ET partitioning and T/ET estimation. © 2023 by the authors.",eddy covariance; ET partitioning; machine learning; the ratio of transpiration to evapotranspiration; XGBoost,Ecosystems; Forestry; Machine learning; Remote sensing; Soils; Statistical tests; Transpiration; Vegetation; Water supply; Eddy covariance; Evaporation estimation; Evapotranspiration partitioning; Leaf Area Index; Machine learning models; Machine-learning; Soil evaporations; The ratio of transpiration to evapotranspiration; Vapor pressure deficit; Xgboost; Evapotranspiration,Yes,Yes,"eddy covariance, weather station, remote sensing","climate & meteorology, vegetation indices, soil",1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0

A comprehensive objective function of optimization involves minimizing (i) difference between weekly plant nitrogen uptake and requirement and (ii) nitrate losses (nitrate leaching and accumulated nitrate in the root zone). Coupling a simulation model to an optimization algorithm for obtaining the objective function variables (N plant uptake and nitrate losses) typically requires long runtimes as the simulation model is repeatedly applied over iterations of the optimization algorithm. One attractive way to reduce the programming and computational demands associated with optimization is to construct a simpler, faster, but sufficiently accurate emulator of the simulation model based on machine-learning model. This study assessed the performance of convolutional neural networks (CNN) in modelling nitrate uptake by maize and estimation of nitrate losses in surface drip irrigation in three texturally different soils. To do this, the CNN was trained on output of the simulation model HYDRUS-2D. Various combinations of parameters influencing daily nitrate uptake (daily potential crop evapotranspiration, irrigation water and injected fertilizer amount) were evaluated as model inputs. Results indicated that daily nitrate uptake at any time t was predicted best with inputs of daily potential evapotranspiration at time t, irrigation and fertilizer amounts of the previous 1–7 days and the previous day's nitrate uptake amount. Estimated nitrate losses for constant weekly fertigation (CWF) were about 32% in sandy loam and 38.5% in sandy clay loam soil. Variable weekly fertigation (VWF) reduced the nitrate losses to 24.5% in sandy loam and 31.5% in sandy clay loam soil, while losses in loam soil were intermediate to these. The study demonstrates that CNN estimation of nitrate uptake and root zone losses can be widely used in optimization of fertigation management. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; HYDRUS-2D; Model emulation,Agricultural pollution; Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Crops; Deep learning; Evapotranspiration; Fertilizers; Irrigation; Leaching; Learning systems; Nitrates; Soils; Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Fertigations; HYDRUS-2D; Model emulation; Nitrate loss; Nitrate uptake; Optimisations; Root zone; Simulation model; artificial neural network; drip irrigation; estimation method; hydrological modeling; leaching; machine learning; maize; nitrate; nutrient uptake; performance assessment; rhizosphere; Optimization,Yes,Yes,Not Specified,"climate & meteorology, vegetation indices",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0

In this study, we propose a surface energy balance constrained deep learning (DL-SEB) model for simulating global land surface evapotranspiration (ET). The accuracy of the DL-SEB model in estimating ET was tested using FLUXNET observations. The results suggested that the proposed DL-SEB model significantly enhanced the simulation capability of extreme ET events compared with the original deep learning model (without being coupled with the energy balance equation). The DL-SEB model was further applied to reconstruct global ET changes during 2000–2019 based on meteorological, soil, vegetation, and flux data sets. The annual average global land surface ET was 613 mm/yr during the period 2000–2019 (exclude Antarctica and deserts). The global land surface ET exhibited a significant upward trend with average increase rate of 1.16 mm/yr during the past two decades, which corresponds to approximately 3.8% increase above the mean global ET during 2000–2019. The positive trend of global land surface ET was driven by the combined effect of air temperature (Ta), soil moisture (SM), net radiation flux (Rn) and leaf area index (LAI). The natural climatic events such as El Niño events significantly altered short-term global ET variation, but did not changed the long-term increase trend of global ET. This study enhanced the understanding of the impact of climate change on the global land surface ET.

Data from 122 Automated Weather Stations (AWS) across different regions in Southern Spain has been studied and four machine learning models have been developed and assessed: Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The results indicate that all machine learning models outperform the traditional Hargreaves-Samani method in estimating ET0. Specifically, ELM performed, on average, as the best in terms of Global Performance Indicator (GPI) for those locations situated in the first region (GPI = 0.1860), while MLP outperformed the rest for those located in the second (GPI = 0,1162). Besides, the configuration using minimum, mean and maximum air temperature (Tx, Tm, Tn, respectively), the diurnal temperature range (DTR), and Extraterrestrial solar radiation features (Ra) was found to be the fittest for the second region (GPI = 0.0734) and that using Tx, Tn, Tm and Ra in the first one in (GPI = 0.1938). Once the models were validated, they were applied to future 5 km gridded projection datasets, using different Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios, in order to estimate ET0 up to the year 2100. In general, the projected ET0 was found to increase significantly in the future, with Mann Kendall Z values that ranged from 7.11 to 10.37 in the RCP4.5 scenario and from 10.84 to 12.57 in the RCP8.5 scenario. Thus, the ET0 is expected to increase from 1300 to 1600 mm to 1500–1700 mm using the RCP4.5 and to 1900 mm using the RCP8.5 in Andalusia, with the highest increase occurring in the south coastal region.

However, the question of whether to use all data for modeling or only a specific subset for modeling and its implications are rarely investigated explicitly. As a case study, combining evapotranspiration (ET) observations from 168 flux stations, meteorological and biophysical variables, we used Random Forests to separately construct an 'All data' model trained with all data and 6 'plant functional type (PFT) specific' models trained with specific PFT data (i.e., Forest, Grassland, Cropland, Shrubland‚ Savannah, Wetland). We found ET simulations between different specific PFTs are transferable. The 'All data' model captured better ET and had a higher R-squared at 94 of 168 sites, especially in Wetland, Shrubland, Cropland, and Grassland types. Compared to using the 'All data' model, the 'PFT specific' model can further improve the accuracy in high R-squared grassland sites by reducing the effect of confusion of other PFTs and constraining the variance of the training data. When shifting from the 'All data' model to the 'PFT specific' model, the increase in the degree of encapsulation of the training set into the prediction set leads to a decrease in the R-squared.

Thus, this study explores the potential of two machine learning models (random forest (RF) and long short-term memory (LSTM)) and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) to forecast ET o. The investigation was conducted for four weather stations in Egypt, from 1982 to 2020. The machine learning models were evaluated using four combinations of inputs: maximum and minimum temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed. The best results for both RF and LSTM models were achieved with the first set of inputs that included all four variables at both regional and local scales. For the regional scale, RF and LSTM models achieved R 2 values of 0.85 and 0.86, respectively, with RMSE values of 0.69 and 0.68 mm/day. At the local scale, RF and LSTM models exhibited R 2 values ranging from 0.92 to 0.95 and 0.93 to 0.95, respectively, while RMSE ranged between 0.38 and 0.46 mm/day and 0.37–0.43 mm/day, respectively. Additionally, ARIMA models were employed for tim series analysis of the same ET o data. ARIMA (2,1,4) and ARIMA (2,1,3) were found to be the most suitable models for the local-scale analysis while ARIMA (2,1,4) was identified as the optimal model for the regional-scale analysis. For the local-scale analysis, R 2 values ranged from 0.86 to 0.91 and RMSE values ranged from 0.26 to 0.38. The regional scale analysis yielded an R 2 value of 0.89 and an RMSE value of 0.58 mm/day.

Evapotranspiration prediction is essential as it indicates rice water demand in advance depending on several environmental conditions and soil moisture prediction helps to judiciously schedule irrigation based on soil water balance. Several environmental parameters are having impact on evapotranspiration and soil moisture prediction. In order to select correlated environmental parameters with evapotranspiration and soil moisture, salp swarm algorithm which is improved using opposition based learning, local search algorithm, and a control parameter called inertia weight (ISSA) is used. Feature Weighted K-Nearest Neighbor is consolidated with ISSA to assess the quality of selected environmental parameters. Evapotranspiration is predicted using individual machine learning models and ensemble learning but individual machine learning models suffers from high bias and variance in prediction and cannot provide the desired prediction accuracy. Boosting outperform all the models with Mean Absolute Error (MAE) [0.10, 0.03, 0.05], Mean Squared Error (MSE) [0.15, 0.09, 0.109], Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) [0.387, 0.300, 0.330], Nash Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) [0.959, 0.948, 0.692] and Coefficient of determination (R2) [0.962, 0.941, 0.697] for evapotranspiration prediction in vegetative, reproductive and ripening growth stages respectively using selected features.

It is computed for most applications as a product of reference crop evapotranspiration (ET0) and crop coefficient, notably using the well-known two-step method. Accurate predictions of reference evapotranspiration (ET0) using limited meteorological inputs are critical in data-constrained circumstances. Due to the unavailability and heterogeneity of broad parameters of the FAO PM method, it becomes a major constraint for accurately estimating ET0. To overcome the complexity of calculation, the present study was focused on developing a Random Forest-based (RF) ET0 model to estimate the crop ET for the semi-arid region of northwest India. The RF-based model was developed by focusing on the easily available data at the farm level. For comparative study existing models like Hargreaves–Samani, Modified Penman and modified Hargreaves–Samani were used to estimate the ET0. The models' calibration and validation were done using meteorological data collected from the weather station of Punjab Agricultural University for 21 years (1990–2010) and nine years (2011–2019), respectively, and the FAO PM model was taken as a standard. The mean absolute error (MAE) and root-mean-square error (RMSE) were found to be least as 0.95 mm/d and 1.32 mm/d, respectively for the developed RF model, with an r2 value of 0.92. The seasonal ET0 estimated by modified Hargreaves–Samani (MHS) and RF were found as 498.3, 482.1 mm in rabi season and 755, 744.8 mm in kharif season respectively, whereas the annual ET0 was 1380.2 and 1355.7 mm respectively. The predicted ET0 values by RF-based model were used for irrigation scheduling of two growing seasons (2020–2021) of maize and wheat crops. The outcome of the field trial also demonstrates that there was no appreciable yield drop in the crop when compared to irrigation scheduling by the FAO PM model, demonstrating the applicability of the developed model for irrigation in the semiarid region of the Punjab in India. © 2023",FAO PM; Hargreaves–Samani model; Irrigation scheduling; Modified Hargreaves–Samani model; Random forest algorithm; Reference evapotranspiration,,Yes,Yes,"weather station, empirical models",climate & meteorology,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

Vapor Pressure Deficit is one of the ET parameters that has a significant impact on its calculation (VPD). This paper forecasts VPD using ensemble learning-based modeling in eight different regions (Dakahliyah, Gharbiyah, Kafr Elsheikh, Dumyat, Port Said, Ismailia, Sharqiyah, and Qalubiyah) in Egypt. In this study, six machine learning algorithms were used: Linear Regression (LR), Additive regression trees (ART), Random SubSpace (RSS), Random Forest (RF), Reduced Error Pruning Tree (REPTree), and Quinlan's M5 algorithm (M5P). Monthly vapor pressure data were obtained from the Japanese 55-year Reanalysis JRA-55 from 1958 to 2021. The dateset has been divided into two segments: the training stage (1958–2005) and the testing stage (2006–2021). Five statistical measures were used to evaluate the model performances: Correlation Coefficient (CC), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Relative absolute error (RAE), and Root Relative Squared Error (RRSE), across both training and testing stages. RF model outperformed the rest of the models [CC = 0.9694; MAE = 0.0967; RMSE = 0.1252; RAE (%) = 21.7297 and RRSE (%) = 24.0356], followed closely by REPTree and RSS models. On the other hand, M5P model performance remained moderate and both LR and AR model were the worst. During the testing stage, RF outperformed the rest of the models in terms of (which statistic), followed closely by REPTree and RSS models. On the other hand, M5P performance remained moderate and both LR and AR models were the worst. This study recommended using the RF model for future hydro-climatological studies in general, and vapor pressure deficit modeling and prediction in particular. This study enables future magnitudes to be predicted, alerting the authorities and administrators involved to focus their policy-making on more specific pathways toward climate adaptation. © 2023","Agricultural Water Management; Machine Learning, Random Subspace; Meteorological Data; Partial auto-correlation function; REPTree","Egypt; Climate change; Developing countries; Errors; Forecasting; Forestry; Hydrostatic pressure; Learning algorithms; Mean square error; Vapor pressure; Water management; Agricultural water management; Autocorrelation functions; Machine learning, random subspace; Machine-learning; Meteorological data; Partial auto-correlation function; Random subspaces; Reduced error pruning tree; Reduced-error pruning; Vapor pressure deficit; evapotranspiration; machine learning; semiarid region; vapor pressure; water management; Machine learning",Yes,Yes,Not Specified,climate & meteorology,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Meteorological variables of the Brazilian Pantanal were studied and used to determine evapotranspiration with fewer variables. It was found that artificial intelligence can substantially improve environmental modeling when alternative prediction techniques are used, resulting in lower project costs and more reliable results. This work tried to find the best combination by comparing machine learning techniques such as artificial neural networks, random forests, and support vector machines. A new model was created that depends on fewer climatic variables compared to the Penman–Monteith method (the standard method for estimating reference evapotranspiration) and can efficiently describe the reference evapotranspiration. Machine learning techniques are highly efficient for modeling environmental systems since they can process large amounts of data and find the best interactions between the parameters involved. In addition, more than 98% accuracy was obtained using fewer variables compared to the standard method when artificial neural networks are utilized. © 2023 by the authors.",artificial intelligence; artificial neural networks; climate change; combination; Pantanal,,Yes,Yes,"weather station, empirical models",climate & meteorology,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

They hold special relevance during drought, where wrecked sap flow can undermine overall tree growth and development. The present study encompasses five-year (2012–2015 and 2017) sap flow datasets on European beech (Fagus sylvatica). Four different techniques were used for sap flow modeling, namely, a linear model (LM), random forest (RF), extreme gradient boosting machine (XGBM), and neural networks (NN). We used six variants (Variants 1–6) differing in the captured conditions and the dataset size. The ‘prediction power’ was the ratio of the predicted and observed sap flow. We found the LM had the maximum prediction power for the overall sap flow in beech trees with 1 h shift of global radiation. In the reaming variants, the LM provided comparable prediction power to RF and XGBM. At the same time, NN exhibited relatively poor prediction power over other machine learning models.

Machine learning has potential in large-scale GPP prediction, but its application accuracy and impact factors still need further research. This paper takes the Mongolian Plateau as the research area. Six machine learning methods (multilayer perception, random forest, Adaboost, gradient boosting decision tree, XGBoost, LightGBM) were trained using remote sensing data (MODIS GPP) and 14 impact factor data and carried out the prediction of grassland GPP. Then, using flux observation data (positions of flux stations) and remote sensing data (positions of non-flux stations) as reference data, detailed accuracy evaluation and comprehensive trade-offs are carried out on the results, and key factors affecting prediction performance are further explored. The results show that: (1) The prediction results of the six methods are highly consistent with the change tendency of the reference data, demonstrating the applicability of machine learning in GPP prediction. (2) LightGBM has the best overall performance, with small absolute error (mean absolute error less than 1.3), low degree of deviation (root mean square error less than 3.2), strong model reliability (relative percentage difference more than 5.9), and a high degree of fit with reference data (regression determination coefficient more than 0.97), and the prediction results are closest to the reference data (mean bias is only −0.034). (3) Enhanced vegetation index, normalized difference vegetation index, precipitation, land use/land cover, maximum air temperature, potential evapotranspiration, and evapotranspiration are significantly higher than other factors as determining factors, and the total contribution ratio to the prediction accuracy exceeds 95%. They are the main factors influencing GPP prediction.

An extremely heavy rainstorm occurred in Zhengzhou City, Henan Province on 20 July 2021, causing heavy casualties and economic losses. One of the important reasons for this rainstorm was abnormal water circulation. The purpose of this study is to estimate ET0 accurately and avoid extreme disasters caused by abnormal water cycles. This study compared and analyzed the accuracy and robustness of ET0 prediction based on the improved Levenberg-Marquardt (L-M) model based on artificial neural network and the genetic algorithm-backward neural network (GA-BP) model. The model uses seven weather stations in Zhengzhou, including mountain climate and plain climate. By utilizing the Pearson correlation analysis technique, six distinct input scenarios were identified, and the efficacy of the model was assessed using evaluation metrics, including RMSE, MAE, NSE, and SI. The results show that the estimation accuracy of the L-M model is better than that of the GA-BP model; when the number of input meteorological parameters is the same, the combined simulation effect including wind speed is the best; the R2 of L-M3 and L-M4 are 0.9285 and 0.9675, respectively; models can accurately estimate ET0 with limited data. © 2023 IWA Publishing.

To accurately calculate winter wheat ETc with limited meteorological data, the present study proposed two interpretable machine learning (ML) models (random forest (RF) and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost)) as well as non-interpretable ML models (support vector machine (SVM) and deep neural network (DNN)) based on the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm using observed winter wheat ETc data during the period from 2007 to 2013 at Luan Cheng Agro-ecosystem Experimental Station. Mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), coefficient of determination (R2), and global performance indicator (GPI) were used to assess the performance of models. This demonstrated that the ML models based on the crop coefficient (Kc) and solar radiation (Rn) were accurate and offered a workaround for calculating winter wheat ETc in the absence of meteorological data. In four ML models, the ninth input combination, consisting of Kc, Rn, daily air maximum temperature (Tmax), daily air minimum temperature (Tmin), sunshine hours (n), and wind speed with a height of 2 m (U2), produced the best estimate of ETc. Among them, the PSO-based SVM (PSO-SVM) model obtained the best results for estimating ETc with MAE, RMSE, NSE, R2, and GPI values of 0.389 mm·d−1, 0.562 mm·d−1 0.910, 0.911, and 0.975, respectively, showing the advantages of the non-interpretable ML model in ETc forecasting. Accurate descriptions of actual hydrological and climatic processes were given by local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME). The inflection points of daily climatic parameters (Tmin, Tmax, Rn, n) related to ETc were determined to be 3.80 °C, 5.50 °C, 1.62 MJ·m−2·d−1, 1.37 h, respectively.

To shed light on the underlying mechanisms driving soil moisture drought, the statistical multiple linear regression, machine learning, and modeling experiments methods have been pervasively used in early studies. However, these methods neglect the collinearity and interactions of climate variables, and thus cannot reflect the direct and indirect interaction of factors leading to soil moisture drought. To reveal the synergistic effects of water supply and demand on soil moisture drought, this study quantified the contributions of key drivers to the change of soil moisture drought by a path analysis method to exhibit the relationships between atmospheric movement state and soil moisture drought. Prior to applying the systematic path analysis model, we identified the spatial patterns of soil moisture droughts at different depths by using a state-of-art three-dimensional drought recognition method in China. Our results showed that precipitation deficits dominated the interannual variation of soil moisture drought while increasing potential evapotranspiration only had marginal intensification in drought. The response of soil moisture drought to potential evapotranspiration was magnified by drought deterioration, especially in basically severe drought conditions. The total column water vapor and the horizontal divergence of the vapor flux, as well as temperature, directly affected precipitation and potential evapotranspiration and led to soil moisture drought through various direct and indirect processes. This study highlighted that the interactions among precipitation, potential evapotranspiration, and atmospheric vapor movement state in space and time were important for understanding the drought development mechanisms. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",Drought severity; Path analysis; Soil moisture drought; Standardized soil moisture index,China; Deterioration; Drought; Economics; Evapotranspiration; Horizontal wells; Linear regression; Water supply; Analysis method; Drought severity; Machine-learning; Multiple linear regressions; Path analysis; Pathway analysis; Potential evapotranspiration; Soil moisture drought; Soil moisture index; Standardized soil moisture index; annual variation; drought; path analysis; potential evapotranspiration; precipitation intensity; soil moisture; water supply; water vapor; Soil moisture,Yes,Yes,Not Specified,"climate & meteorology, vegetation indices, soil",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0

To improve the prediction accuracy of ETC for early and late rice, this study analyzed the importance of the influencing factors based on a categorical regression tree (CART) machine learning algorithm. Based on the importance results of the influencing factors obtained from CART analysis, different combinations of input factors were constructed, and daily ETC prediction models were developed for early and late rice using the least squares support vector machine (LSSVM). A three-element heuristic optimization algorithm, Sine Cosine Algorithm (SCA), Slime Mold Algorithm (SMA), and Sparrow Search Algorithm (SSA), were used to optimize the ETC model to improve the performance of the early and late rice ETC prediction models. The results of this study revealed that the strongest correlation between early and late rice ETC was net solar radiation (Rn), with importance of 0.830 and 0.802, respectively. The next strongest correlations were temperature (T), wind speed (u), soil moisture (SM) and u, leaf area index (LAI), SM (0.092, 0.02, 0.014 and 0.058, 0.049, 0.034), respectively. The accuracy of the model tended to increase as the number of influencing factors in the input combinations constructed based on the importance results increased. The accuracy of the model increased more rapidly when the input factors were one to four and the accuracy of the model increased slightly when the input factors were more than four.

New spaceborne products such as ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS) are promising tools for closing such observation gaps in understudied tropical areas. Using ECOSTRESS ET data across a large, protected tropical forest region (2250 km2) situated on the western slope of the Andes, we predicted ET for different days. ET was modeled using a random forest approach, following best practice workflows for spatial predictions. We used a set of topographic, meteorological, and forest structure variables from open-source products such as GEDI, PROBA-V, and ERA5, thereby avoiding any variables included in the ECOSTRESS L3 algorithm. The models indicated a high level of accuracy in the spatially explicit prediction of ET across different locations, with an r2 of 0.61 to 0.74. Across all models, no single predictor was dominant, and five variables explained 60% of the models’ results, thus highlighting the complex relationships among predictor variables and their influence on ET spatial predictions in tropical mountain forests. The leaf area index, a forest structure variable, was among the three variables with the highest individual contributions to the prediction of ET on all days studied, along with the topographic variables of elevation and aspect. We conclude that ET can be predicted well with a random forest approach, which could potentially contribute to closing the observation gaps in tropical regions, and that a combination of topography and forest structure variables plays a key role in predicting ET in a forest on the western slope of the Andes. © 2023 by the authors.",aspect; Ecuador; elevation; ERA5; GEDI; leaf area index; machine learning; mountain forest; PROBA-V; remote sensing,Evapotranspiration; Forestry; Machine learning; Remote sensing; Space stations; Topography; Tropics; Aspect; Ecuador; Elevation; ERA5; GEDI; Leaf Area Index; Machine-learning; Mountain forests; PROBA-V; Remote-sensing; Forecasting,Yes,Yes,"weather station, remote sensing","climate & meteorology, vegetation indices",0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0

Accurate estimation of ETo has long been an eminent topic of interest in the research community for its importance in effective planning and sustainable water resource management. Although the FAO-56 Penman-Monteith (PM) equation has been accepted as a standard equation for ETo measurement, the primary concern that inhibits the applicability of this equation is the requirement for all the climatological variables, which might not be available at a given location. Owning to the remarkable success and accuracy achieved by Artificial Intelligence (AI) in almost every sphere, scientists have proposed the usage AI models for ETo prediction as an alternate to the conventional methods. This comprehensive review will serve to raise awareness regarding the various state-of-the-art standalone AI frameworks, along with capturing the intriguing developments in the advanced AI space such as the hybrid and ensemble models, evolutionary models and a range of optimization techniques. The results from the publications published over the last 15 years (2007–2022) for ETo prediction using AI under varied agro-climatic scenarios have been analysed and synthesized. The advantages and disadvantages of the established AI techniques have been discussed in each subsection. Some of the derived insights and major findings are discussed along with the future research recommendations.

In this regard, two tree-based machine learning models, which are extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) and random forest (RF), were constructed to predict evapotranspiration (ET), net ecosystem carbon exchange (NEE), and methane flux (FCH4) in seven rice paddy sites. During the training process, the k-fold cross-validation algorithm by splitting the available data into multiple subsets or folds to avoid overfitting, and the XGBoost model was used to assess the importance of input factors. When predicting ET, the XGBoost model outperformed the RF model at all sites. Solar radiation was the most important input to ET predictions. Except for the KR-CRK site, the prediction for NEE was that the XGBoost models also performed better in the other six sites, and the root mean square error decreased by 0.90–11.21% compared to the RF models. Among all sites (except for the absence of net radiation (NETRAD) data at the JP-Mse site), NETRAD and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) performed well for predicting NEE. Air temperature, soil water content (SWC), and longwave radiation were particularly important at individual sites. Similarly, the XGBoost model was more capable of predicting FCH4 than the RF model, except for the IT-Cas site. FCH4 sensitivity to input factors varied from site to site. SWC, ecosystem respiration, NDVI, and soil temperature were important for FCH4 prediction.

Indeed, the increasing demands of agricultural production, coupled with increasingly frequent drought events in many parts of the world, necessitate a more careful evaluation of crop water requirements. Artificial Intelligence-based models represent a promising alternative to the most common measurement techniques, e.g. using expensive Eddy Covariance (EC) towers. In this context, the main challenges are choosing the best possible model and selecting the most representative features. The objective of this research is to evaluate two different machine learning algorithms, namely Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and Random Forest (RF), to predict daily actual evapotranspiration (ETa) in a citrus orchard typical of the Mediterranean ecosystem using different feature combinations. With many features available coming from various infield sensors, a thorough analysis was performed to measure feature importance, scatter matrix observations, and Pearson's correlation coefficient calculation, which resulted in the selection of 12 promising feature combinations. The models were calibrated under regulated deficit irrigation (RDI) conditions to estimate ETa and save irrigation water. On average up to 38.5% water savings were obtained, compared to full irrigation. Moreover, among the different input variables adopted, the soil water content (SWC) feature appears to have a prominent role in the prediction of ETa. Indeed, the presented results show that by choosing the appropriate input features, the accuracy of the proposed machine learning models remains acceptable even when the number of features is reduced to only 4. The best performance was achieved by the Random Forest method, with seven input features, obtaining a root mean square error (RMSE) and a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.39 mm/day and 0.84, respectively. Finally, the results show that the joint use of SWC, weather and satellite data significantly improves the performance of evapotranspiration forecasts compared to models using only meteorological variables. © 2023 The Authors",Actual evapotranspiration; Artificial Neural Network; Citrus orchard; Machine learning; Multi-Layer Perceptron; Random Forest; Regulated deficit irrigation,agricultural ecosystem; artificial neural network; evapotranspiration; irrigation system; machine learning; orchard; satellite data; soil water,Yes,Yes,"eddy covariance, weather station, remote sensing",climate & meteorology,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Inspired by the success of such methods, this paper introduces a new ensemble approach that integrates capabilities of two top state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) methods, namely random forests (RF) and genetic programming (GP), to model and forecast meteorological drought onset and severity. The new method, called gene-random forest (GeRF), follows the same steps of a standard GP systems, but with differences in the generation of initial population of potential solutions. The GeRF was tested to model and predict standardized precipitation evapotranspiration indices (SPEI-3 and SPEI-6) at two meteorology stations in Ankara province, Turkey.

The current study evaluated the performance of different artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms and their ensembles in forecasting Crop Evapotranspiration (ETc) and Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI) against calculated single crop coefficient FAO56 ETc and Jackson's theoretical CWSI, respectively. Soil moisture, canopy temperatures (Tc) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) were all measured from irrigated and non-irrigated maize plots in West Central Nebraska during 2020 and 2021 growing seasons. There were fifteen and twelve input combinations used for ETc and CWSI predictions, respectively, having input variables such as weather and soil moisture as well as ancillary variables, including NDVI, reference evapotranspiration (ETr), and cumulative growing degree days (CGDDs). While evaluating the models, four statistical performance indicators including coefficient of determination (r2), root mean square error (RMSE), mean absoluter error (MAE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) were used. Furthermore, ranking scores were performed on statistical results to find the overall best model across all the input combinations. Based on total ranking scores, CatBoost (RMSE ranging between 0.06 – 0.09 unitless) was the best model in predicting CWSI, while Stacked Regression (RMSE ranging between 0.27 – 0.72 mm d−1) was the best model for ETc estimation.

Lake is the important indicator in arid and semi-arid areas, and to achieve the proper management of the water resources in a lake basin, it is crucial to estimate and predict the lake dynamics, based on hydro-meteorological variations and anthropogenic disturbances. This task is particularly challenging in arid and semi-arid regions, where water scarcity poses a significant threat to human life. In this study, a typical arid area of China was selected as the study area, and the performances of eight widely used ML models (i.e., Bayesian Ridge (BR), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT), Extra Trees (ET), Random Forest (RF), Adaptive Boosting (AB), Bootstrap aggregating (Bagging), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB)) were evaluated in predicting lake area. Monthly lake area was determined by meteorological (precipitation, air temperature, Standardised Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI)) and anthropogenic factors (ETc, NDVI, LUCC). Lake area determined by Landsat satellite image classification for 2000–2020 was analysed side-by-side with the Standardised Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) on 9 and 12-month time scales. With the evaluation of six input variables and eight ML algorithms, it was found that the RF models performed best when using the SPEI-9 index, with R2 = 0.88, RMSE = 1.37, LCCC = 0.95, and PRD = 1331.4 for the test samples. Furthermore, the performance of the ML model constructed with the 9-month time scale SPEI (SPEI-9) as an input variable (MLSPEI-9) depended on seasonal variations, with the average relative errors of up to 0.62 in spring and a minimum of 0.12 in summer. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the effectiveness of different ML models for predicting lake area by demonstrating that the right inputs can lead to a remarkable increase in performance of up to 13.89%. These findings have important implications for future research on lake area prediction in arid zones and demonstrate the power of ML models in advancing scientific understanding of complex natural systems. © 2023 by the authors.",Google Earth Engine (GEE); lake area; machine learning (ML); remote sensing; SPEI,Adaptive boosting; Arid regions; Decision trees; Forecasting; Lakes; Machine learning; Nearest neighbor search; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Arid area; Google earth engine; Google earths; Lake areas; Machine learning; Machine learning models; Machine-learning; Performance; Remote-sensing; Standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index; Evapotranspiration,Yes,Yes,"weather station, remote sensing","climate & meteorology, vegetation indices",0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0

The FAO-PM56 method is recommended globally for estimating ET0 and evaluating alternative methods due to its extensive theoretical foundation. Numerous meteorological parameters, needed for ET0 estimation, are difficult to obtain in developing countries. Therefore, alternative ways to estimate ET0 using fewer climatic data are of critical importance. To estimate ET0 with alternative methods, difference climatic parameters of temperatures, relative humidity (maximum and minimum), sunshine hours, and wind speed for a period of 20 years from 1996 to 2015 were used in the study. The data were recorded by 11 meteorological observatories situated in various climatic regions of Pakistan. The significance of the climatic parameters used was evaluated using sensitivity analysis. The machine learning techniques of single decision tree (SDT), tree boost (TB) and decision tree forest (DTF) were used to perform sensitivity analysis. The outcomes indicated that DTF-based models estimated ET0 with higher accuracy and fewer climatic variables as compared to other ML techniques used in the study. The DTF technique, with Model 15 as input, outperformed other techniques for the most part of the performance metrics (i.e., NSE = 0.93, R2 = 0.96 and RMSE = 0.48 mm/month). The results indicated that the DTF with fewer climatic variables of mean relative humidity, wind speed and minimum temperature could estimate ET0 accurately and outperformed other ML techniques. Additionally, a non-linear ensemble (NLE) of ML techniques was further used to estimate ET0 using the best input combination (i.e., Model 15). It was seen that the applied non-linear ensemble (NLE) approach enhanced modelling accuracy as compared to a stand-alone application of ML techniques (R2 Multan = 0.97, R2 Skardu = 0.99, R2 ISB = 0.98, R2 Bahawalpur = 0.98 etc.). The study results affirmed the use of an ensemble model for ET0 estimation and suggest applying it in other parts of the world to validate model performance. © 2023 by the authors.",ensemble approach; limited meteorological data; machine learning techniques; reference evapotranspiration,,Yes,Yes,"weather station, empirical models",climate & meteorology,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

The models included multiple linear regression (MLR), least square-support vector machine (LS-SVM), artificial neural networks (ANNs) and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). The daily meteorological data for 50 years (1970–2019) were used to estimate ET0 using FAO-ET calculator. The FAO-ET calculator was compared with ML models to investigate the best-fit ML model for predicting ET. Thereafter, ET predicted by the best-fit ML model was compared with satellite (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer – MODIS) ET, which was finally mapped to a larger landscape (over entire Punjab and Haryana). Modeling of ET0 was best performed through LS-SVM followed by ANN2, ANN1, ANFIS10, ANFIS2, MLR and ANFIS9 models. Among developed models, coefficient of determination (R2) value varied from 0.800 to 0.998, being highest (0.998) under LS-SVM model. MODIS overestimated ET when compared with LS-SVM having R2 and root mean square error (RMSE) values of 0.73 and 3.95 mm, respectively. After applying the bias correction factor, R2 and RMSE were 0.74 and 1.19 mm, respectively.

The present study proposed a novel deep learning (DL) approach for daily ET0 estimations with limited daily climate data: HS- LSTM. This approach was constructed based on a classic ET0 model and a long short-term memory neural network (LSTM). Specifically, the Hargreaves-Samani (HS) model was employed as the classic model, and the predictors were restricted to the daily maximum and minimum air temperature data. Ground truth data for ET0 were employed to train, validate, and test the models. Traditional machine learning (ML) algorithms comprising adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), genetic programming (GP), multi-gene genetic programming (MGGP), and one-dimensional CNN (1D-CNN), as well as the HS-ML models (HS-ANFIS, HS-GP, HS-MGGP, HS-1D-CNN), were also established and assessed for daily ET0 estimations. Compared to the other tested approaches, the errors of the HS-LSTM technique significantly decreased, demonstrating that the novel HS-LSTM approach significantly outperformed the other techniques beyond the study area (in Songliao Basin, Northeast China, which is a semi-humid zone with temperate continental climate). The developed models can then be used to estimate future ET0 with only air temperature forecasts, which can be readily obtained from public weather forecasts.

Additionally, most of the new water distribution networks in IDs have been designed to be operated on-demand complexing ID managers the daily decision-making process. The knowledge of the water demand several days in advance would facilitate the management of the system and would help to optimize the water use and energy costs. For an efficient management and optimization of the water-energy nexus in IDs, longer term forecasting models are needed. In this work, a new hybrid model (called LSTMHybrid) combining Fuzzy Logic (FL), Genetic Algorithm (GA), LSTM encoder-decoder and dense or full connected neural networks (DNN) for the one-week forecasting of irrigation water demand at ID scale has been developed. LSTMHybrid was developed in Python and applied to a real ID. The optimal input variables for LSTMHydrid were mean temperature (°C), reference evapotranspiration (mm), solar radiation (MJ m−2) and irrigation water demand of the ID (m3) from 1 to 7 days prior to the first day of prediction. The optimal LSTMHybrid model selected consisted of 50 LSTM cells in the encoder submodel, 409 LSTM cells in the decoder submodel and three hidden layers in the DNN submodel with 31, 96 and 128 neurons in each hidden layer, respectively.

In this study, multi-step (i.e., 1, 3, 7, and 10)-ahead daily ETo at 30 sites is forecasted using three hybrid machine learning approaches: wavelet long short-term memory (WLSTM), wavelet group method of data handling (WGMDH), and wavelet genetic algorithm-adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (WGA-ANFIS). The 30 sites are chosen to sample nine climate regions across the contiguous United States. Three input scenarios are considered. This study emphasizes on forecasting ETo using limited meteorological variables. In the first scenario, we consider only solar radiation (Rs) as the input variable owing to the largest correlation coefficient (R) between ETo and Rs compared with the other meteorological variables in most of the study sites. In the second scenario, in addition to Rs, the daily maximum (Tx), minimum (Tn), and mean (Tm) air temperatures are used. The input variables for the third scenario are Rs, Tx, Tn, Tm, and the relative humidity (RH). Data pertaining to 2005–2014 and 2015–2019 are used for the training and forecasting phases, respectively. The model forecasts are compared against ETo estimates from the Penman–Monteith (PM) equation. The third input scenario yields the most accurate results based on the average over all the study sites. In this input scenario, the WLSTM outperforms the other models for 1-day-ahead ETo forecasting in terms of the 30-site average root mean square error (RMSE) = 0.541 mm/d, Nash–Sutcliffe coefficient (NS) = 0.946, and R = 0.973. In contrast, WGMDH outperforms WLSTM and WGAANFIS for 3-, 7-, and 10-day-ahead ETo forecasting with RMSEs of 0.636, 0.649, and 0.651 mm/d; NS of 0.925,0.922, and 0.921; and R of 0.962, 0.961, and 0961, respectively. The highest performances of all models are observed in the Northwest and West climate regions, which exhibit the strongest correlation between Rs and ETo. The accuracy decreases in the South climate region with the weakest correlation between Rs and ETo. The lowest values of Rs, Tn, Tx, and Tm and highest RH are observed in winter. Consequently, among the seasons, the minimum RMSE (highest NS and R) is observed in winter. The worst performance of the models is observed in summer, which involves the highest values of Rs, Tx, Tn, and Tm. The deteriorated performance of the models in warm months is attributable to the high ETo values, as the models cannot accurately capture the peaks of ETo. Deep learning models (i.e., WLSTM and WGMDH) yield more accurate ETo forecasts and can thus facilitate agricultural water management and irrigation scheduling. © 2023 The Authors",Agricultural water management; Artificial intelligence; Crop water requirement; Irrigation scheduling; Sustainable agriculture; Water resources conservation,United States; Climate models; Data handling; Decision making; Deep learning; Evapotranspiration; Forecasting; Fuzzy neural networks; Fuzzy systems; Genetic algorithms; Irrigation; Learning systems; Mean square error; Water conservation; Water management; Water supply; Agricultural water management; Climate regions; Crop water requirements; Group method of data handling; Hybrid machine learning; Irrigation scheduling; Learning models; Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient; Performance; Sustainable agriculture; alternative agriculture; artificial intelligence; evapotranspiration; genetic algorithm; machine learning; relative humidity; solar radiation; water management; water resource; wavelet analysis; Fuzzy inference,Yes,Yes,"weather station, empirical models",climate & meteorology,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

Artificial neural networks (ANNs), deep neural networks (DNN), M5 model tree (M5Tree), random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbor (kNN), and adaptive boosting were investigated as machine learning approaches. Determination of evapotranspiration in this study consists of three methods: (i) The reference evapotranspiration (ETo) was obtained from the Food and Agriculture Organization-56 Penman–Monteith equation, (ii) the values of evapotranspiration (ETc) calculated by multiplying the reference evapotranspiration by the crop coefficient (K c), and (iii) the values of evapotranspiration (ETa) measured using soil water balance between successive soil water measurements as the outputs. The model’s performance in ETo estimation was higher when minimum and maximum temperature (T max and T min), wind speed (u 2), average relative humidity (RHavg), solar radiation (R s), and days of the year were used as inputs. The best performance was obtained in the ANN model with a coefficient of determination (R 2) value of 0.984, a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.098 mm d−1, a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.153 mm d−1, and Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency of 0.983. The model’s performance in ETc estimation was significantly improved with the addition of leaf area index (LAI) and crop height (h c) to the climate parameters (MAE and RMSE values decreased by 22.6 and 23.2%, respectively). The accuracy of ETc estimation for some plant traits (h c and LAI) and average temperature (T avg) was sufficient.

However, limited data concerning minerals’ interactive effects on transpiration hinder the integration of the mineral matrix into irrigation planning. Hence, we set to (1) characterize the effects of mineral availability on almond trees’ transpiration and (2) integrate climatic variables and physiological measurements to predict irrigation requirements under various mineral compositions. We constructed 0.9 m3 lysimeters to measure trees’ transpiration, hydraulics, growth, and reproduction in a wide range of nitrogen, phosphorus, or potassium concentrations. At peak summer, almond trees’ with optimal fertilization transpired 6.5 mm day−1, meeting the potential environmental demands. Potassium had a negligible effect on transpiration, while low phosphorus (≤ 1 mg L−1), low nitrogen (≤ 10 mg L−1), and high nitrogen (≥ 100 mg L−1) concentrations in the irrigation reduced maximal transpiration to 3 mm day−1. Transpiration changes corresponded to the trees’ canopy and stem growth rates rather than their stomatal conductance or water potential. We tested multivariable interactions to select parameters for transpiration predictions. A general boosting model (GBM) exhibited better training and validation performances than three alternative computations (linear, nonlinear, or support vector machine), integrating physiological parameters through machine learning. The transpiration predictions were reinforced by their correlation to yield, implying that almond trees’ basic annual water requirements are 360 mm, yet they require 900 mm to reach full potential.

Furthermore, research investigations should focus on ETc and ETo to fill existing knowledge gaps and advance both theoretical understanding and practical applications. Future studies should aim to contribute to the understanding of the impacts of climate change on ETc by leveraging machine learning techniques and enhancing our understanding of crop water requirements and their application in irrigation management, while also ensuring continuous updates to the existing body of knowledge to meet future challenges. © 2023 W.B.

Methods Taking the typical alpine marsh wetland on the Qingzang Plateau as the observation station to study evapotranspiration, combined with meteorological factors (net radiation, air temperature, soil heat flux, wind speed, relative humidity, soil volumetric water content), we established a prediction model to construct an actual evapotranspiration data set with a high-precision interpolation method based on combining five methods including multiple linear regression (MLR), decision tree (CART), random forest (RF), support vector regression (SVR) and multi-layer perceptron (MLP). Important findings 1) The correlation between evapotranspiration and net radiation was the largest in the study area, and soil heat flux was the key factor affecting the evapotranspiration process. 2) The determination coefficients are from 0.58 to 0.83 among five machine learning algorithm models with seven combinations, and the root mean square error ranges from 0.038 to 0.089 mm·30 min–1. 3) The random forest regression model has the highest determination coefficient, the best model stability and the best interpolation. 4) Interpolated evapotranspiration data had the same diurnal variation trend with net radiation, soil heat flux and ari temperature, but the opposite diurnal variation trend with wind speed and relative humidity. Daily evapotranspiration is mainly concentrated in the growing season, with the daily maximum (8.77 mm) on July 9 and the daily minimum (0.21 mm) on January 30. ©植物生态学报 Chinese Journal of Plant Ecology.",alpine marshes; cross validation; evapotranspiration; machine learning,alpine environment; areal interpolation; diurnal variation; evapotranspiration; machine learning; plateau,Yes,Yes,weather station,"climate & meteorology, soil",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0

ET 0 is calculated based on several meteorological variables such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and solar radiation. However, in many regions, there may be limited availability of these meteorological data, making it difficult to estimate ET 0 using conventional methods. This study aimed at using machine learning (ML) techniques to estimate ET 0 with minimal climatic inputs, using the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)-56 Penman–Monteith model as the standard reference method. Different ML models, including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks, Gradient Boosting Regressor (GBR), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Regression (SVR), were developed with climatic variables as input parameters. To summarize, the study evaluated different machine learning models to estimate ET 0 with minimal climatic inputs and compared their performance with the standard Penman–Monteith model for Hawalbagh experimental farm observatory. The results showed that the LSTM model performed better than other ML models, followed by SVR and RF, in estimating ET 0 with minimal climate data. The study concluded that LSTM and SVR models are the most robust ML models for estimating ET 0 in such scenarios. The study found that even with limited climatic data, such as a two-parameter combination (maximum temperature and relative humidity, relative humidity and sunshine hours) or a three-parameter combination (minimum temperature, relative humidity, and precipitation, minimum temperature, maximum temperature, and precipitation), promising results in ET 0 estimation can be achieved. The study's findings are significant for estimating ET 0 in data-scarce regions, especially for agricultural water management in semi-arid climates. © 2023, Indian Academy of Sciences.",Evapotranspiration; gradient boosting regressor; long short-term memory; Penman–Monteith; random forest; support vector regression,Almora; India; Uttarakhand; estimation method; evapotranspiration; machine learning; numerical model; parameter estimation; regression analysis; support vector machine,Yes,Yes,"weather station, empirical models",climate & meteorology,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

Machine learning techniques like elastic net (ELNET), K-nearest neighbours (KNN), multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), partial least squares regression (PSLR), random forest (RF), support vector regression (SVR), XGBoost and cubist were employed to predict daily reference evapotranspiration based on daily weather parameters of twenty years. Penman-Monteith method was used as the reference method for ET0 estimation. All models performed well during calibration showing 2 higher coefficient of determination (R) which ranged from 0.97 (for PLSR) to 1 (for cubist models). Mean-1-1 absolute error during calibration ranges from 0.027 mm d for cubist to 0.607 mm d for ELNET. Cubist model 2-1-1 (R = 1, MAE = 0.017 mm d, RMSE = 0.027 mm d) outperformed other models during the calibration.

Based on statistical parameters, 2-1-1 best performance was observed for cubist model (R = 1, RMSE = 0.06 mm d, MAE = 0.031 mm d) among the studied machine learning models for the prediction of reference evapotranspiration.

In this study, we developed models for crop coefficients (Kc) estimation using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing and machine learning (ML) techniques for irrigated maize in a semi-arid region in Northwest China. Kc values were calculated using a procedure given in FAO56 manual using field measurements. Multispectral vegetation indices (VIs), vegetation fraction (VF), thermal-based VIs, and texture information (TI) were derived from UAV-based multispectral, RGB, and thermal infrared imagery, respectively. These remotely sensed variables and their combinations were used to develop prediction models using six ML algorithms (linear regression-LR, polynomial regression-PR, exponential regression-ER, random forest regression-RFR, support vector regression-SVR, and deep neural network-DNN). Among these models, the RFR with the highest accuracy (R2 = 0.69, RMSE = 0.1019) was recommended to estimate maize Kc. The multispectral and thermal-based VIs and texture of the near-infrared band had greater contributions than RGB-based VF and TI in the Kc-RFR model under different irrigation treatments. Furthermore, the maize Kc-RFR prediction model had high accuracy in estimating cumulative evapotranspiration (R2 = 0.89, RMSE = 15.0 mm/stage) during different growth stages and daily soil water content (R2 = 0.85, RMSE = 0.0089 m3/m3) in the root zone. These results show that the integration of UAV remote sensing and ML provides a promising tool to help farmers make decisions using timely mapped crop water consumption, especially under water shortages or drought conditions. © 2022 The Authors",Crop coefficient; Crop water requirement; Evapotranspiration; FAO56; Random Forest regression; UAV,China; Antennas; Crops; Deep neural networks; Farms; Forecasting; Forestry; Infrared devices; Irrigation; Learning systems; Regression analysis; Remote sensing; Soil moisture; Textures; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Vegetation; Water management; Water supply; Aerial vehicle; Crop coefficient; Crop water consumption; Crop water requirements; FAO56; Random forest regression; Random forests; Remote machines; Unmanned aerial vehicle; Vegetation index; crop plant; drought; evapotranspiration; remote sensing; satellite imagery; satellite sensor; semiarid region; soil water; unmanned vehicle; Evapotranspiration,Yes,Yes,"remote sensing, field measurement, empirical models","climate & meteorology, vegetation indices",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0

Combining recent advances in satellite-based ET mechanistic algorithms and data-oriented methods allows ET hybrid modeling by coupling physical constraints with machine learning (ML). Specifically, we developed two hybrid models, a surface conductance-based ML model (ML-Gs) and a soil evaporation-based ML model (ML-Es), to estimate regional ET on the TP. These hybrid models have biophysical framework, under which one of the parameters or components is modeled using ML. Hybrid models make ML complementary to the process-based ET framework, which to find an optimal junction between well physical mechanism and high model performance. The daily ET estimates were evaluated at 28 eddy covariance flux tower sites, as well as by comparison with two process-based ET algorithms (a Penman–Monteith-based ET-PM algorithm and a Priestley-Taylor-based ET-PT algorithm) and a data-oriented pure ML method. The hybrid models decreased the root-mean-square-error (RMSE) of two physical algorithms (1.11 mm/day for ET-PM, 1.09 mm/day for ET-PT) to 0.50 mm/day, and increased the Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE) (0.35 for ET-PM, 0.36 for ET-PT) to 0.92. Our hybrid models also showed improved performance (KGE of 0.65) than pure ML (KGE of 0.62) at data-sparse regions as well as for the responses to extreme weather events. It indicates that our approach does not only boost the ET simulation accuracy, but also improve the physical understanding of ML-based ET estimation. More importantly, ML-Es focuses on the ET components on the TP and is more well-defined than ML-Gs. An innovation of our approach is that for data-sparse regions and extreme cases, the more robust physical mechanism was coupled, the better generalization performance of hybrid model could achieve. The spatiotemporal ET patterns based on our hybrid models were consistent with the variations in local climatic regions and could provide critical information on the understanding of hydrological processes under the global and regional climate changes. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.",Evapotranspiration; Hybrid model; Machine learning; Physical constraints; Tibetan Plateau,China; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau; Couplings; Evapotranspiration; Learning algorithms; Mean square error; Satellites; Hybrid model; Hydrometeorology; Machine learning models; Machine-learning; Model machine; Physical constraints; Physical mechanism; Process-based; Third poles; Tibetan Plateau; eddy covariance; evapotranspiration; machine learning; regional climate; satellite imagery; Machine learning,Yes,Yes,"eddy covariance, weather station, remote sensing, empirical models","climate & meteorology, vegetation indices, soil",1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0

Last 2 decades, machine learning (ML) techniques have enabled scientists to develop powerful tools to study ET0 patterns in the ecosystem. This study investigated the feasibility and effectiveness of three ML techniques, including the k-nearest neighbor algorithm, multigene genetic programming, and support vector regression (SVR), to estimate daily ET0 in Türkiye. In addition, different interpolation techniques, including ordinary kriging (OK), co-kriging, inverse distance weighted, and radial basis function, were compared to develop the most appropriate ET0 maps for Türkiye. All developed models were evaluated according to the performance indices such as coefficient of determination (R2), root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE). Taylor, violin, and scatter plots were also generated. Among the applied ML models, the SVR model provided the best results in determining ET0 with the performance indices of R2 = 0.961, RMSE = 0.327 mm, and MAE = 0.232 mm. The SVR model’s input variables were selected as solar radiation, temperature, and relative humidity. Similarly, the maps of the spatial distribution of ET0 were produced with the OK interpolation method, which provided the best estimates. © 2023, The Author(s).",Evapotranspiration; Geostatistic; Interpolation; Machine learning,Turkey; Evapotranspiration; Genetic algorithms; Genetic programming; Inverse problems; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Mean square error; Nearest neighbor search; Optimal systems; Radial basis function networks; Spatial distribution; Geo-statistics; Machine learning techniques; Machine-learning; Mean absolute error; Ordinary kriging; Performance indices; Reference evapotranspiration; Root mean square errors; Support vector regression models; Waters resources; evapotranspiration; interpolation; machine learning; relative humidity; spatial distribution; water resource; Interpolation,Yes,Yes,Not Specified,climate & meteorology,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Machine learning (ML) based on readily obtained information on the cropping system, typically including spectral reflectance measurements, is an essential approach for achieving practical solutions. We tested in a 9-year soil compaction experiment the accuracy of ML-based yield predictions made up to 2 months before harvest from a Ratio Vegetation Index (RVI) and recordings of precipitation and reference evapotranspiration. The applied data set comprises 224 combinations of plots and years with measured grain yields in the range of 4.22–9.34 Mg/ha. The best ML model [i.e., with the smallest mean absolute error (MAE)] was selected automatically by the AutoML interface included in the R program package H2O. Its cross-validated predictions made on June 30 more than 1 month before harvest showed an MAE of 0.38 Mg/ha when trained on all data from all years except the one under consideration. MAE increased to about 0.68 Mg/ha when determined 3 weeks earlier on June 10. MAE values in the range of 0.32–0.42 Mg/ha were obtained for predictions made on June 30 when based on data from at least six consecutive years; however, MAE showed no generally decreasing trend with the number of years. Yield estimations were robust towards a considerable soil variation observed within the experimental area due in part to the experimental treatments. The results show a potential of making yield predictions in barley 1–2 months before harvest, which, however, is not sufficiently early to support decisions on top-dress N fertilization. © 2023 The Authors.

The efficient spatial prediction of soil water content is crucial for ensuring crop growth and food production. To this end, 104 farmland soil samples were collected in the Yellow River Delta (YRD) in China, and the soil water content was determined using the drying method. A gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) model based on a tree-structured Parzen estimator (TPE) hyperparametric optimization was developed, and then the soil water content was predicted and mapped based on the soil texture and vegetation index from Sentinel-2 remote sensing images. The results of statistical analysis showed that the soil water content had a high coefficient of variation (55.30%), a non-normal distribution, and complex spatial variability. Compared with other models, the TPE-GBDT model had the highest prediction accuracy (RMSE = 6.02% and R2 = 0.71), and its mapping results showed that the areas with high soil water content were distributed on both sides of the river and near the estuary. Furthermore, the results of Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) analysis showed that the soil texture (PC2 and PC5), modified normalized difference vegetation index (MNDVI), and Sentinel-2 red edge position (S2REP) index provided important contributions to the spatial prediction of soil water content. We found that the hydraulic physical properties of soil texture and the vegetation characteristics (such as vegetation coverage, root action, and transpiration) are the key factors affecting the spatial migration and heterogeneity of the soil water content in the study area. The above results show that the TPE algorithm can quickly capture the hyperparameters that are most suitable for the GBDT model, so that the GBDT model can ensure prediction accuracy, reduce the loss function with less training data, and accurately learn of the nonlinear relationship between soil water content and environmental factors. This paper proposes a machine learning method for hyperparameter optimization that shows considerable potential to predict the spatial heterogeneity of soil water content, which can effectively support regional farmland soil and water conservation and high-quality agricultural development. © 2023 by the authors.",farmland; GBDT; hyperparameter; machine learning; Sentinel-2; soil water content,,Yes,Yes,remote sensing,"vegetation indices, soil",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0

Machine learning (ML) algorithms provide new opportunities to integrate agronomic information with ground-based and satellite data and develop flexible yield predictive models. In particular, satellite-based vegetation indices and evapotranspiration provide robust proxies for crop yield estimations in the absence of measurements; nevertheless, most prior model development efforts have focused on using only vegetation indices due to the simplicity of the process. Additionally, the contribution of input categories (i.e., field, meteorological, and satellite data) and the use of appropriate proxies, aligned with the crop growth stages, in developing yield predictive models have not been adequately investigated. To address these challenges, we employed two ML techniques, Random Forest (RF) and extreme gradient boosting algorithm (XGB), to estimate wheat yield using meteorological variables, satellite-driven actual evapotranspiration (ETa), and vegetation indices (VIs). ETa was separately computed using the surface energy balance concept and the METRIC model. The models were first trained and tested in the study area using three input combinations: i) meteorological variables, ii) satellite data, and iii) an ensemble of meteorological and satellite data. Then, the best-performing model was further evaluated using two independent datasets. We found ETa to be particularly important in improving the accuracy of the model predictions. Among the vegetation indices, EVI, EVI2, and NDVI during May, and among the meteorological data, growing degree days during the grain filling stage plus minimum temperature in the stem elongation stage had the highest contributions to yield predictions. Both ML algorithms generated relatively accurate results, where XGB was marginally more accurate than RF, considering an average mean absolute error of 0.39 t ha-1 for XGB and 0.50 t ha-1 for RF. Normalized root-mean-square errors of the ensemble, satellite-derived and meteorological-derived models in XGB were 0.05, 0.07, and 0.10, respectively. Nevertheless, both algorithms’ performances deteriorated in predicting the yield values beyond the range of the training set, though XGB could handle the extrapolation process more efficiently than RF. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",Extreme gradient boosting; Machine learning; METRIC; Random forest; Vegetation indices; Winter wheat; Yield prediction,algorithm; energy balance; evapotranspiration; machine learning; NDVI; satellite data; surface energy; wheat; yield response,Yes,Yes,"weather station, remote sensing, field measurement","climate & meteorology, vegetation indices",0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0

Accurately estimating ET is crucial for understanding global climate change, ecological environmental problems, the water cycle, and hydrological processes. Machine learning (ML) algorithms have been considered as a promising method for estimating ET in recent years. However, due to the limitations associated with the spatial–temporal resolution of the flux tower data commonly used as the target set in ML algorithms, the ability of ML to discover the inherent laws within the data is reduced. In this study, a hybrid framework was established to simulate ET in data-deficient areas. ET simulation results of a coupled model comprising the Budyko function and complementary principle (BC2021) were used as the target set of the random forest model, instead of using the flux station observation data. By combining meteorological and hydrological data, the monthly ET of the Inner Mongolia section of the Yellow River Basin (IMSYRB) was simulated from 1982 to 2020, and good results were obtained (R2 = 0.94, MAE = 3.82 mm/mon, RMSE = 5.07 mm/mon). Furthermore, the temporal and spatial variations in ET and the influencing factors were analysed. In the past 40 years, annual ET in the IMSYRB ranged between 241.38 mm and 326.37 mm, showing a fluctuating growth trend (slope = 0.80 mm/yr), and the summer ET accounted for the highest proportion in the year. Spatially, ET in the IMSYRB showed a regular distribution of high ET in the eastern region and low ET in the western area. The high ET value areas gradually expanded from east to west over time, and the area increased continuously, with the largest increase observed in the 1980s. Temperature, precipitation, and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) were found to be the most important factors affecting ET in the region and play a positive role in promoting ET changes. These results provide an excellent example of long-term and large-scale accurate ET simulations in an area with sparse flux stations. © 2023 by the authors.",actual evapotranspiration; machine learning; random forest; spatiotemporal distribution,Climate change; Evapotranspiration; Forestry; Watersheds; Actual evapotranspiration; Case-studies; Energy; Hybrid framework; Inner Mongolia; Machine learning algorithms; Machine-learning; Random forests; Spatiotemporal distributions; Yellow River basin; Machine learning,Yes,Yes,"eddy covariance, weather station","climate & meteorology, vegetation indices",1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0

This study is aimed at estimating monthly evapotranspiration (ET) values in Hakkâri province by combining support vector regression, bagged tree, and boosted tree methods with wavelet transform. For this purpose, precipitation, runoff, surface net solar radiation, air temperatures, and previous ET values were divided into sub-signals with various mother wavelets such as Daubechies 4, Meyer, and Symlet 2 and presented as input to machine learning (ML) algorithms. The study’s main contribution to the literature is to reveal which wavelet-based machine learning model, mother wavelet type, and combination of meteorological data show the most realistic results in ET estimation. While establishing the models, the data were divided into 80% training and 20% testing. The models’ performances were based on the widely used root mean square error, mean absolute error, determination coefficient, and Taylor diagrams. As a result of the study, it was revealed that the hybrid wavelet ML, which is established with input combinations separated into subcomponents by wavelet transform, generally produces more successful predictions than the stand-alone ML model. In addition, it was revealed that the optimum ET forecasting model was obtained with the wavelet bagged tree algorithm with Symlet 2 mother wavelet. Even though the best model established is based on the precipitation and temperature inputs, it was revealed that past ET, solar radiation, and runoff values are also effective inputs in ET prediction. The results can also be used in other regions of the world with semi-arid climates, such as Hakkâri.

Artificial intelligence has recently managed to solve several water management challenges. Acquiring suitable data sets, choosing appropriate criteria, and identifying the optimal algorithm are significant challenges in machine learning. Machine learning may be an effective tool for estimating reference evapotranspiration using minimal meteorological inputs. This work aims to estimate the amount of ETo in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa region of Pakistan, highlighted as an important agricultural hub, using machine learning. The machine learning techniques include support vector machines based on radial basis function in conjunction with a random forest, artificial neural network, and deep learning long short-term memory systems with 15 input combinations. The findings showed that all four strategies predicted ETo values with reasonable accuracy and reliability. The support vector regression model with scenario-14 revealed strong results than the others (R2 = 0.9970). The ultimate purpose of this research is to develop the best scenarios with a reasonable accuracy rate and the least amount of input parameters to create the most suitable methodology. Hence, the second most successful models were artificial neural nets and deep learning with scenario-9 and 11, estimating ETo with a higher accuracy level (R2= 0.9768 and 0.9688) during the testing stage.

The daily ET0 data of 11 representative stations in Xinjiang from 1993 to 2016 were selected for model training and testing and compared with the results of support vector regression (SVR) and gradient boosting regression tree (GBRT) as the two empirical machine learning models. The results indicated the superiority of the VMD-BPNN hybrid prediction model to EMD-BPNN and EEMD-BPNN in terms of accuracy and stability, with root mean square error (RMSE) = 0.405 mm/d, mean absolute error (MAE) = 0.268 mm/d, and coefficient of determination (R2) = 0.979. When employing the VMD-BPNN model to forecast ET0 for seven days, the RMSE and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NSE) of the VMD-BPNN model were 0.588 mm/d and 0.952, respectively, and the prediction results indicated high precision and reliability. The prediction accuracy of the VMD-BPNN model was significantly higher than that of single machine learning models, such as BPNN, SVR, and GBRT. The RMSE and MAE values of the VMD-BPNN model were more than 60% smaller than BPNN, SVR, and GBRT models, and R2 and NSE were approximately 18% higher than BPNN, SVR, and GBRT models, respectively. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the VMD method in reducing the non-stationarity of the original daily ET0 data.

The recognition of key factors plays a vital role and thus affects the performance of the model. However, there is no conclusion on which recognition algorithm is the most suitable. To address this issue, an LSTM model combined with two attention mechanisms both in the input and hidden layers, namely AT-LSTM, is proposed for long-term runoff forecasting at Yichang and Pingshan stations in China. The added attention mechanisms automatically assign weights to 130 climate phenomenon indexes, avoiding the use of subjectively set recognition algorithms. Results show that the AT-LSTM model outperforms the Pearson’s correlation based LSTM model in terms of four evaluation metrics for monthly runoff forecasting. Further, the set indirect runoff prediction method verifies that the AT-LSTM model also performs effectively in precipitation and potential evapotranspiration forecasting, and the indirect runoff prediction is inferior to the AT-LSTM model to establish a direct link between climate factors and runoff. Finally, four key factors related to runoff are identified by the attention mechanism and their impacts on runoff are analyzed on intra- and inter-annual scales. The proposed AT-LSTM model can effectively improve the accuracy of long-term forecasting and identify the dynamic influence of input factors. © 2023 The Author(s).

The present investigation assessed the capability of four machine learning algorithms, namely, XGBoost linear regression (XGBoost Linear), XGBoost Ensemble Tree, Polynomial Regression (Polynomial Regr), and Isotonic Regression (Isotonic Regr) in modeling daily reference evapotranspiration (ETo) at IARI, New Delhi. The models were developed considering full and limited dataset scenarios. The efficacy of the constructed models was assessed against the Penman–Monteith (PM56) model estimated daily ETo. Results revealed the under full and limited dataset conditions, XGBoost Ensemble Tree gave the best results for daily ETo modeling during the model training period, while in the testing period under scenarios S1(Tmax) and S2 (Tmax, and Tmin), the Isotonic Regr models yielded superior results over other models. In addition, the XGBoost Ensemble Tree models outperformed others for the rest of the input data scenarios. The XGBoost Ensemble Tree algorithms reported the best values of correlation coefficient (r), mean absolute error (MAE), mean square error (MSE), root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). Thus, we recommend applying the XGBoost Ensemble Tree algorithm for precisely modeling daily ETo in semi-arid climatic conditions. © 2023 The Authors.",box plot; irrigation scheduling; machine learning; mean absolute error; model ranking; Taylor diagram,Algorithms; Intelligence; Delhi; India; New Delhi; Errors; Evapotranspiration; Input output programs; Irrigation; Learning algorithms; Mean square error; Regression analysis; Statistical tests; Box plot; Daily evapotranspirations; Ensemble trees; Input datas; Irrigation scheduling; Machine-learning; Mean absolute error; Model ranking; Reference evapotranspiration; Taylor diagrams; algorithm; climate conditions; evapotranspiration; irrigation system; machine learning; semiarid region; spatiotemporal analysis; algorithm; article; climate; correlation coefficient; drug efficacy; evapotranspiration; intelligence; machine learning; mean absolute error; root mean squared error; Machine learning,Yes,Yes,empirical models,climate & meteorology,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

However, these models may produce inconsistent results when solving linear problems. To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes hybridizations of ML and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models to provide a more accurate and general forecasting model for evapotranspiration (ET0). The proposed models are developed and tested using daily ET0 data collected over 11 years (2010–2020) in the Samsun province of Türkiye. The results show that the ARIMA–GRNN model reduces the root mean square error by 48.38%, the ARIMA–ANFIS model by 8.56%, and the ARIMA–ANN model by 6.74% compared to the traditional ARIMA model. Consequently, the integration of ML with ARIMA models can offer more accurate and dependable prediction of daily ET0, which can be beneficial for many branches such as agriculture and water management that require dependable ET0 estimations. © 2023 by the authors.",artificial intelligence; Box–Jenkins; evapotranspiration; time series modeling,Samsun; artificial intelligence; ecological modeling; evapotranspiration; hybrid; machine learning; time series; water management,Yes,Yes,Not Specified,climate & meteorology,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

However, it is difficult to directly obtain these values with fine spatial representation at regional scales using conventional ground-based measurement methods. Therefore, airborne measurements of turbulent flux are highly advantageous. By leveraging airborne measurements of H and LE fluxes collected in the Netherlands in August 2008, in this study we evaluated five machine learning methods for the construction of a regional gridded heat flux map, including artificial neural networks, boosted regression trees, random forest regression, deep neural networks, and support vector regression. The models were trained and tested using a dataset compiled from observations of H and LE, the digital elevation model, MODIS land surface temperature, enhanced vegetation index, and albedo data for each flux footprint. The best performing model was used to construct a regional gridded heat flux map over a case region located in the center of the Netherlands. The results shown that the support vector regression performed better than other models, with R2=0.91,RMSE=9.6W/m2 for H, and R2=0.89,RMSE=26.32W/m2 for LE. The constructed heat flux maps achieved a relative prediction error of ≤32.8% (R2>0.71) for H and ≤43.5% (R2>0.53) for LE compared to aircraft measurements. The constructed heat flux maps were then aggregated for each land cover type, providing individual estimates of source strength (52< H< 66 W/m2 and 108< LE< 218 W/m2) and spatial variability (52< σH< 66 W/m2 and 108< σLE< 218 W/m2) with an ensemble precision of < 6% (1σ).

One such issue is the potential underestimation of ET when relative humidity (RH) is high (>70%), due to low-pass filtering with some EC systems. Yet, this underestimation for different types of EC systems (e.g. open-path or closed-path sensors) has not been characterized for synthesis datasets such as the widely used FLUXNET2015 dataset. Here, we assess the RH-associated underestimation of latent heat fluxes (LE, or ET) from different EC systems for 163 sites in the FLUXNET2015 dataset. We found that the LE underestimation is most apparent during hours when RH is higher than 70%, predominantly observed at sites using closed-path EC systems, but the extent of the LE underestimation is highly site-specific. We then propose a machine learning based method to correct for this underestimation, and compare it to two energy balance closure based LE correction approaches (Bowen ratio correction, BRC, and attributing all errors to LE). Our correction increases LE by 189% for closed-path sites at high RH (>90%), while BRC increases LE by around 30% for all RH conditions. Additionally, we assess the influence of these corrections on ET-based transpiration (T) estimates using two different ET partitioning methods. Results show opposite responses (increasing vs. slightly decreasing T-to-ET ratios, T/ET) between the two methods when comparing T based on corrected and uncorrected LE. Overall, our results demonstrate the existence of a high RH bias in water fluxes in the FLUXNET2015 dataset and suggest that this bias is a pronounced source of uncertainty in ET measurements to be considered when estimating ecosystem T/ET and WUE. © 2022",Eddy covariance; Energy balance closure; Evapotranspiration; FLUXNET; Latent energy,eddy covariance; energy balance; evaporation; hydrological cycle; latent heat flux; measurement method; relative humidity; transpiration,Yes,Yes,eddy covariance,climate & meteorology,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

The high computational cost of regional climate models (RCMs) limits how many GCMs can be dynamically downscaled, restricting uncertainty assessment. While statistical downscaling is cheaper, its validity in a changing climate is unclear. We combine these approaches to build an emulator leveraging the merits of dynamical and statistical downscaling. A machine learning model is developed for each coarse grid cell to predict fine grid variables, using coarse-scale climate predictors with fine grid land characteristics. Two RCM emulators, one Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and one Multiple Linear Regression error-reduced with Random Forest (MLR-RF), are developed to downscale daily evapotranspiration from 12.5 km (coarse-scale) to 1.5 km (fine-scale). Out-of-sample tests for the MLP and MLR-RF achieve Kling-Gupta-Efficiency of 0.86 and 0.83, correlation of 0.89 and 0.86, and coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.78 and 0.75, with a relative bias of −6% to 5% and −5% to 4%, respectively. Using histogram match for spatial efficiency, both emulators achieve a median score of ∼0.77. This is generally better than a common statistical downscaling method in a range of metrics. Additionally, through “spatial transitivity,” we can downscale GCMs for new regions at negligible cost and only minor performance loss. The framework offers a cheap and quick way to downscale large ensembles of GCMs. This could enable high-resolution climate projections from a larger number of global models, enabling uncertainty quantification, and so better support for resilience and adaptation planning. © 2023 The Authors.",hybrid downscaling; machine learning; multilayer perceptron; spatial transitivity; subgrid variability,algorithm; climate modeling; downscaling; evapotranspiration; machine learning,Yes,Yes,Not Specified,climate & meteorology,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

However, most current urban ET models are based on the energy balance theory to estimate urban ET. These models lead to significant errors in urban ET simulation due to the surface heterogeneity and the existence of anthropogenic heat fluxes in urban areas. To solve this issue, this study proposes a modified machine learning-based urban ET method that can estimate urban ET at the site and regional scales. To better characterize the heterogeneity of urban surfaces, the flux footprint of in-situ ET and physical mechanism of ET process are integrated into the convolutional neural network (CNN) model. The modified CNN model is tested in a fast-developing city: Shenzhen, China based on two Eddy Correlation (EC) observations. The verification results indicated that coupling flux footprint and physical mechanism into the CNN model could effectively improve the accuracy of urban ET simulation at the site scale. The modified CNN model significantly reduced the root-mean-square-error (RMSE) of 25.8 W/m2 and increased the determination coefficient (R2) of 0.17 compared to the CNN-O model (The CNN-O model is defined as the CNN model do not integrate flux footprint and physical mechanism of ET). Further analyses suggested that fusing flux footprint data into a machine learning model helps enhance ET estimation in regions with high heterogeneity and highly variable wind directions. Moreover, the integration of physical mechanisms significantly enhanced the model capability to simulate extreme ET events. The modified CNN model is further applied to map the spatial distribution of urban ET and reconstruct long-term urban ET changes. The spatial pattern of urban ET exhibited large spatial variability, where the urban ET in water bodies (mean λET larger than 480 W/m2) and vegetation-covered areas (mean λET larger than 260 W/m2) are substantially higher than the impervious surfaces (mean λET less than 30 W/m2). Long-term trend analyses demonstrated that urbanization resulted in decline in urban ET. The average decreasing rate of urban ET is 1.61 mm/yr (P < 0.05), with a 18 % decrease relative to the long-term ET average. The leading causes for the decline of urban ET are the increased impervious surfaces and the decreased radiation. This study improved the simulation accuracy of urban ET and revealed the response of urban ET to urbanization. © 2022",Convolutional neural network; Eddy correlation; Flux footprint; Urban evapotranspiration; Urbanization,China; Guangdong; Shenzhen; Atmospheric temperature; Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Integration; Machine learning; Mean square error; Urban growth; Convolutional neural network; Eddy correlations; Flux footprint; Impervious surface; Neural network model; Physical mechanism; Urban evapotranspiration; Urban water resources; Urbanization; Water resource allocation; artificial neural network; energy balance; evapotranspiration; heat island; machine learning; urbanization; Evapotranspiration,Yes,Yes,Not Specified,climate & meteorology,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

However, the spatial generalizability of ET estimating ML models is still questionable, especially in regions with significant climatic variation like Turkey. Aiming at exploring this generalizability, this study compares two ET modeling approaches: (1) one general model covering all of Turkey, (2) seven regional models, one model for each of Turkey’s seven regions. In both approaches, ET was predicted using 16 input combinations and 3 ML methods: support vector regression (SVR), Gaussian process regression (GPR), and random forest (RF). A cross-station evaluation was used to evaluate the models. Results showed that the use of regional models created using SVR and GPR methods resulted in a reduction in root mean squared error (RMSE) in comparison with the general model approach. Models created using the RF method suffered from overfitting in the regional models’ approach. Furthermore, a randomization test showed that the reduction in RMSE when using these regional models was statistically significant. These results emphasize the importance of defining the spatial extent of ET estimating models to maintain their generalizability. © 2022, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Institute of Geophysics, Polish Academy of Sciences & Polish Academy of Sciences.",Cross-station assessment; Gaussian processes; Generalizability; Machine learning; Reference evapotranspiration; Regional models,Turkey; Decision trees; Evapotranspiration; Gaussian distribution; Gaussian noise (electronic); Mean square error; Cross-station assessment; Gaussian Processes; General model; Generalizability; Machine learning models; Machine-learning; Modeling approach; Reference evapotranspiration; Regional modelling; Support vector regressions; assessment method; climate variation; evapotranspiration; machine learning; Machine learning,Yes,Yes,weather station,climate & meteorology,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Consequently, the focal aims of the investigation are to assess the potential of machine learning models in forecasting irrigation water requirements (IWR) of snap beans by evolving multi-scenarios of inputs parameters to figure out the impact of meteorological, crop, and soil parameters on IWR. Six models were applied, support vector regressor (SVR), random forest (RF), deep neural networks (DNN), convolutional neural networks (CNN), long short-term memory (LSTM), and Hybrid CNN-LSTM. Ten variables including maximum and minimum temperature, Relative humidity, wind speed, precipitation, root depth, basal crop coefficient, soil evaporation, a fraction of surface wetted and, exposed and soil wetted fraction were used as the input data for models with their combination, 8 input scenarios were designed. Overall models, the best scenario was scenario 4 (relative humidity, wind speed, basal crop coefficient, soil evaporation), however, the best scenario for DNN and RF model was scenario 7 (root depth, basal crop coefficient, soil evaporation, fraction of surface wetted, exposed and soil wetted fraction). While the weakest one was the group of climatic factors in scenario 6 (maximum temperature, minimum temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and precipitation). Among the models, the hybrid LTSM & CNN was the most accurate and the SVR model had the lowest estimation accuracy. The outcomes of this research work could set up a modeling strategy that would set in motion the improvement of efforts to identify the shortages in IWR forecasting, which sequentially may support alleviation strategies such as policies for sustainable water use and water resources management.

In addition, Sc is a physiological indicator that is widely employed to detect crop water stress. Unfortunately, existing methods for measuring canopy Sc are time-consuming, laborious, and poorly representative. Methods: To solve these problems, in this study, we combined multispectral vegetation index (VI) and texture features to predict the Sc values and used citrus trees in the fruit growth period as the research object. To achieve this, VI and texture feature data of the experimental area were obtained using a multispectral camera. The H (Hue), S (Saturation) and V (Value) segmentation algorithm and the determined threshold of VI were used to obtain the canopy area images, and the accuracy of the extraction results was evaluated. Subsequently, the gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) was used to calculate the eight texture features of the image, and then the full subset filter was used to obtain the sensitive image texture features and VI. Support vector regression, random forest regression, and k-nearest neighbor regression (KNR) Sc prediction models were constructed, which were based on single and combined variables. Results: The analysis revealed the following: 1) the accuracy of the HSV segmentation algorithm was the highest, achieving more than 80%. The accuracy of the VI threshold algorithm using excess green was approximately 80%, which achieved accurate segmentation. 2) The citrus tree photosynthetic parameters were all affected by different water supply treatments. The greater the degree of water stress, the lower the net photosynthetic rate (Pn), transpiration rate (Tr), and Sc of the leaves. 3) In the three Sc prediction models, The KNR model, which was constructed by combining image texture features and VI had the optimum prediction effect (training set: R2 = 0.91076, RMSE = 0.00070; validation set; R2 = 0.77937, RMSE = 0.00165). Compared with the KNR model, which was only based on VI or image texture features, the R2 of the validation set of the KNR model based on combined variables was improved respectively by 6.97% and 28.42%. Discussion: This study provides a reference for large-scale remote sensing monitoring of citrus Sc by multispectral technology. Moreover, it can be used to monitor the dynamic changes of Sc and provide a new technique for gaining a better understanding of the growth status and water stress of citrus crops.

Several issues need to be addressed while developing a crop yield estimation model, including data quality issues, data processing issues, selecting a suitable machine learning model that can learn from few available time-series data, and understanding the non-linear relationship between historical crop yield and remote sensing and meteorological factors. This study applied a series of data processing techniques and a customized ML model to improve the accuracy of crop yield estimation at the district level in Nepal. It was found that remote sensing-derived NDVI product alone was not sufficient for accurate estimation of crop yield. After incorporating other meteorological variables into the ML models, estimation accuracy improved dramatically. Along with NDVI, the meteorological variables of rainfall, soil moisture, and evapotranspiration also exhibited a strong association with rice yield. This study also found that stacking multiple tree-based regression models together could achieve better accuracy than benchmark linear regression or standalone ML models. Due to the unique and distinct physio-geographical setting of each district, a variation in estimation accuracy from district to district could be observed. Our data processing and ML model workflow achieved an average of 92% accuracy of yield estimation with RMSE 328.06 kg/ha and MAE 317.21 kg/ha. This methodological workflow can be replicated in other study areas and the results can help the local authorities and stakeholders understand the factors affecting crop yields as well as estimating crop yield before harvesting season to ensure food security and sustainability. © 2023 by the authors.",crop phenology; crop yield; crop yield estimation; multisource remotely sensed data; precision agriculture,Crops; Data handling; Food supply; Machine learning; Meteorology; Precision agriculture; Regression analysis; Soil moisture; Crop phenology; Crop yield; Crop yield estimation; Machine learning models; Multi-Sources; Multisource remotely sensed data; Precision Agriculture; Remotely sensed data; Yield estimation; Remote sensing,Yes,Yes,"weather station, remote sensing","climate & meteorology, vegetation indices, soil",0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0

Given the inherent complexity of the agricultural system, this study aimed to develop climate-based yield prediction models using ML, considering the most correlated meteorological variables for each condition, test the best model with independent data, and define zones of higher soybean yield in Mato Grosso do Sul to recommend better planting sites. The study was carried out in two stages. First, meteorological and soybean yield data obtained from 47 locations in the state of Mato Grosso do Sul were used to calibrate the machine learning (ML) algorithms. Second, the best algorithm was used to predict soybean yields throughout Mato Grosso do Sul. Daily meteorological data of air temperature (T, °C), precipitation (P, mm), global solar irradiance (Qg, MJ m−2 day−1), wind speed (u2, m s−1), net radiation (Rn, MJ m−2 day−1), and relative humidity (RH, %) of the NASA-POWER system from 2002 to 2021 were used. The reference evapotranspiration (ETo) by the standard FAO method and water balance (WB) by Thornthwaite and Mather (1955) were calculated for each collection point. The MLs used in this stage consisted of multiple linear regression (MLR), multilayer perceptron (MLP), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), extreme gradient boosting (XGBOOSTING), and gradient boosted decision (GradBOOSTING). The ML models were calibrated using 70% of the data selected for training and 30% for validation. Algorithms were evaluated by accuracy, precision, and tendency. All analyses were performed using Python 3.8 software. Climate variables showed high spatial and seasonal variability throughout Mato Grosso do Sul (MS). Pearson’s univariate correlations between soybean yield and climate variables of the phenological period showed distinct relationships and different intensities. For instance, soil water storage (ARM) showed negative, neutral, and positive correlations in October, November, and December, respectively. The calibrated ML algorithms had a high precision and accuracy in both calibration and testing. For instance, the best model in the calibration was XGBOOSTING, which showed MAPE, R2, RMSE, MSE, and MAE values of 1.84%, 0.95, 2.06%, 4.24%, and 0.921%, respectively.

When climates vary from arid to semi-arid, and there are problems with a lack of meteorological data and a lack of future information on ETo, as is the case in Egypt, it is more important to estimate ETo precisely. To address this, the current study aimed to model ETo for Egypt’s most important agricultural governorates (Al Buhayrah, Alexandria, Ismailiyah, and Minufiyah) using four machine learning (ML) algorithms: linear regression (LR), random subspace (RSS), additive regression (AR), and reduced error pruning tree (REPTree). The Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR) of the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) was used to gather daily climate data variables from 1979 to 2014. The datasets were split into two sections: the training phase, i.e., 1979–2006, and the testing phase, i.e., 2007–2014. Maximum temperature (Tmax), minimum temperature (Tmin), and solar radiation (SR) were found to be the three input variables that had the most influence on the outcome of subset regression and sensitivity analysis. A comparative analysis of ML models revealed that REPTree outperformed competitors by achieving the best values for various performance matrices during the training and testing phases. The study’s novelty lies in the use of REPTree to estimate and predict ETo, as this algorithm has not been commonly used for this purpose. Given the sparse attempts to use this model for such research, the remarkable accuracy of the REPTree model in predicting ETo highlighted the rarity of this study. In order to combat the effects of aridity through better water resource management, the study also cautions Egypt’s authorities to concentrate their policymaking on climate adaptation. © 2023 by the authors.",additive regression; climate-resilient pathways; linear regression; machine learning algorithms; random subspace; reduced error pruning tree; reference evapotranspiration; water resources management,Alexandria [Egypt]; Beheira; Egypt; Additives; Agriculture; Balancing; Climate models; Forecasting; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Meteorology; Regression analysis; Sensitivity analysis; Water supply; Additive regression; Climate-resilient pathway; Machine learning algorithms; Random subspaces; Reduced error pruning tree; Reduced-error pruning; Reference evapotranspiration; Testing phase; Training phasis; Water resources management; algorithm; evapotranspiration; forecasting method; machine learning; regression analysis; resource management; water management; water resource; water supply; Evapotranspiration,Yes,Yes,weather station,"climate & meteorology, vegetation indices",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0

Judicious use of water in agriculture is possible by estimating the optimal requirement. The present practice of estimating crop water requirements is using reference evapotranspiration (ET0) values, which is considered a standard method. Hence, predicting ET0 is vital in allocating and managing available resources. In this study, different machine learning (ML) algorithms, namely random forests (RF), extreme gradient boosting (XGB), and light gradient boosting (LGB), were optimized using the naturally inspired grey wolf optimizer (GWO) viz. GWORF, GWOXGB, and GWOLGB. The daily meteorological data of 10 locations falling under humid and sub-humid regions of India for different cross-validation stages were employed, using eighteen input scenarios. Besides, different empirical models were also compared with the ML models. The hybrid ML models were found superior in accurately predicting at all the stations than the conventional and empirical models. The reduction in the root mean square error (RMSE) from 0.919 to 0.812 mm/day in the humid region and 1.253 mm/day to 1.154 mm/day in the sub-humid region was seen in the least accurate model using the hyperparameter tuning. The RF models have improved their accuracies substantially using the GWO optimizer than LGB and XGB models. © 2023 by the authors.",boosting; evapotranspiration; grey wolf optimizer; humid; machine learning; meta-heuristics; random forests; sub-humid,Canada; Grey; India; Ontario [Canada]; Adaptive boosting; Forestry; Machine learning; Mean square error; Meteorology; Boosting; Gray wolf optimizer; Gray wolves; Humid; Machine learning models; Machine-learning; Metaheuristic; Optimizers; Random forests; Sub-humid; algorithm; evapotranspiration; heuristics; humid environment; machine learning; optimization; prediction; Evapotranspiration,Yes,Yes,weather station,climate & meteorology,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

This paper implemented a hybrid data assimilation and machine learning framework (DA-ML method) into the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model to optimize surface soil and vegetation conditions. The hybrid method can integrate remotely sensed leaf area index (LAI), multi-source soil moisture (SM) observations, and land surface models (LSMs) to accurately describe regional climate and land-Atmosphere interactions. The performance of the hybrid method on the regional climate was evaluated in the Heihe River basin (HRB), the second-largest endorheic river basin in Northwest China. The results show that the estimated sensible (H) and latent heat (LE) fluxes from the WRF (DA-ML) model agree well with the large aperture scintillometer (LAS) observations. Compared to the WRF (open loop-OL), the WRF (DA-ML) model improved the estimation of evapotranspiration (ET) and generated a spatial distribution consistent with the ML-based watershed ET (ETMap). The proposed WRF (DA-ML) method effectively reduces air warming and drying biases in simulations, particularly in the oasis region. The estimated air temperature and specific humidity from WRF (DA-ML) agree well with the observations. In addition, this method can simulate more realistic oasis-desert boundaries, including wetting and cooling effects and wind shield effects within the oasis. The oasis-desert interactions can transfer water vapor to the surrounding desert in the lower atmosphere. In contrast, the dry and hot air over the desert is transferred to the oasis from the upper atmosphere. The results show that the integration of LAI and SM will induce water vapor intensification and promote precipitation in the upstream of the HRB, particularly on windward slopes. In general, the proposed WRF (DA-ML) model can improve climate modeling by implementing detailed land characterization information in basins with complex underlying surfaces.  © 2023 Copernicus GmbH.

Infection from the pathogen, which is initiated in the lower crown, causes needle chlorosis, loss of cellular integrity, necrosis and premature needle loss with this developmental sequence impacting key plant functional traits such as chlorophyll content and leaf area index. This study uses data collected from four year old field grown radiata pine (Pinus radiata D. Don) exhibiting a wide range in disease severity (0 – 58%). Hyperspectral data collected from a UAV was used to determine how plant functional traits inverted from a 3D radiative transfer model (PRO4SAIL), can be used by random forests to improve predictions of disease severity, relative to a model with only narrowband hyperspectral indices. Model precision was assessed on a test dataset that was not used for model fitting and this cross validation process was repeated 50 times to ensure reported results were robust, with the mean precision reported from these repeats. The model of disease severity using narrow band hyperspectral indices was moderately precise (R2 = 0.52). Addition of the inverted plant functional traits markedly improved model precision and this final model strongly predicted disease severity with R2 of 0.85. Analyses of variable importance in the final model showed significant interchange in variable importance as the disease progressed. Early stages of the disease were most readily distinguished from asymptomatic trees (severity = 0%) using variables that predominantly describe changes in photosynthesis (Photochemical Reflectance Index), chlorophyll degradation (Normalized Phaeophytinization Index) and chlorophyll content. In contrast, the more severe impacts of the disease were most well characterised by traits associated with an extreme reduction in transpiration (carotenoid content) and loss of foliage. © 2022",Disease risk assessment; Genetic trials; Genotypes; Machine learning; Red band needle blight,coniferous tree; disease severity; genetic analysis; genotype; leaf area index; satellite imagery; unmanned vehicle,Yes,Yes,Not Specified,"vegetation indices, plant physiology",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1

For this purpose, the potential of six machine learning approaches are examined across different agro climatic zones and cropping seasons. Support Vector Regression (SVR), Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS), Random Forest (RF), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models are first evaluated at the station level for up to 28-day-ahead prediction of daily ETO using meteorological station data as well as gridded ERA5 products. Using meteorological observations, at all three stations, SVR performs the best for a prediction horizon (PH) up to 2-days whereas LSTM performs the best for PH of 7-days. Using ERA5 datasets as input, among the three stations, the best performance is observed in Nagpur, where the best models for real-time and 28-day ahead prediction are LSTM (R2 = 0.847 and MAE = 0.474 mm/day) and RF (R2 = 0.722 and MAE = 0.635 mm/day) respectively. As the PH increases from 2-day to 28-day-ahead, models using ERA5 datasets performs better than those using station observations for most of the cases. Although the prediction performance drops initially with the increase in lead time, the drop in performance between 7-day and 28-day-ahead prediction is negligible. Evaluation of gridwise ETO prediction across entire India, using Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model (GLEAM) dataset as a reference, indicates MLP and CNN as the top performing models. Considering the crop seasons, model performance during Rabi season (October-March) ranged from 0.103 to 0.145 mm/day (MAE) and 0.977 to 0.988 (R2), which is better than the Kharif season (June-September) where MAE ranged from 0.140 to 0.234 mm/day and R2 ranged from 0.906 to 0.962. During the Rabi season, the ETO prediction performance of the arid agro-climatic zone is found to be superior to the other three agro-climatic zones, with the highest range of R2 (0.939 to 0.955) and lowest range of MAE (0.146 to 0.182 mm/day). Even the worst prediction performance, which is observed in the Humid region during the Rabi season, is also reasonably good (R2 = 0.656 to 0.79); thereby establishing the potential of the proposed models in multi-step ahead ETO prediction across various agro-climatic zones and cropping seasons. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",Agro-climatic zone; Convolutional neural network (CNN); Cropping season; Long short-term memory (LSTM); Machine learning (ML); Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP); Multi-step ahead prediction; Reference evapotranspiration,India; Maharashtra; Nagpur; Brain; Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Decision making; Drops; Evapotranspiration; Forestry; Learning algorithms; Multilayer neural networks; Support vector machines; Weather forecasting; Agro-climatic zone; Climatic zone; Convolutional neural network; Cropping seasons; Long short-term memory; Machine learning; Machine-learning; Multi-layer perceptron; Multi-step-ahead predictions; Multilayers perceptrons; Reference evapotranspiration; agrometeorology; algorithm; artificial neural network; crop plant; cropping practice; machine learning; potential evapotranspiration; Long short-term memory,Yes,Yes,weather station,"climate & meteorology, vegetation indices",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0

Vegetation controls Q LE by regulating leaf stomata opening (surface resistance r s in the Big Leaf approach) and by altering surface roughness (aerodynamic resistance r a ). Estimating r s and r a across different vegetation types is a key challenge in predicting Q LE . We propose a hybrid approach that combines mechanistic modeling and machine learning for modeling Q LE . The hybrid model combines a feed-forward neural network which estimates the resistances from observations as intermediate variables and a mechanistic model in an end-to-end setting. In the hybrid modeling setup, we make use of the Penman-Monteith equation in conjunction with multi-year flux measurements across different forest and grassland sites from the FLUXNET database. This hybrid model setup is successful in predicting Q LE , however, this approach leads to equifinal solutions in terms of estimated physical parameters. We follow two different strategies to constrain the hybrid model and therefore control for the equifinality that arises when the two resistances are estimated simultaneously. One strategy is to impose an a priori constraint on r a based on mechanistic assumptions (theory-driven strategy), while the other strategy makes use of more observational data and adds a constraint in predicting r a through multi-task learning of both latent and sensible heat flux ( Q H ; data-driven strategy) together. Our results show that all hybrid models predict the target variables with a high degree of success, with R 2 = 0.82-0.89 for grasslands and R 2 = 0.70-0.80 for forest sites at the mean diurnal scale. The predicted r s and r a show strong physical consistency across the two regularized hybrid models, but are physically implausible in the under-constrained hybrid model. The hybrid models are robust in reproducing consistent results for energy fluxes and resistances across different scales (diurnal, seasonal, and interannual), reflecting their ability to learn the physical dependence of the target variables on the meteorological inputs. As a next step, we propose to test these heavily observation-informed parameterizations derived through hybrid modeling as a substitute for ad hoc formulations in Earth system models. © 2023 The Author(s).

In this study, soil physical and chemical variables and plots characteristics were used through linear mixed and random forest-based modeling to evaluate the determinants of actual evapotranspiration (ETa) and crop water productivity (CWP) in rice in the Kou Valley irrigated scheme in Burkina Faso. Multi-temporal Landsat images were used within the Python module for the Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land model to calculate rice ETa and CWP during the dry seasons of 2013 and 2014. Results showed noticeable spatial variations in PySEBAL-derived ETa and CWP in farmers’ fields during the study period. The distance between plot and irrigation scheme inlet (DPSI), plot elevation, sand and silt contents, soil total nitrogen, soil extractable potassium and zinc were the main factors affecting variabilities in ETa and CWP in the farmers’ fields, with DPSI being the top explanatory variable. There was generally a positive association, up to a given threshold, between ETa and DPSI, sand and silt contents and soil extractable zinc. For CWP the association patterns for the top six predictors were all non-monotonic; that is a mix of increasing and decreasing associations of a given predictor to either an increase or a decrease in CWP. Our results indicate that improving irrigated rice performance in the Kou Valley irrigation scheme would require growing more rice at lower altitudes (e.g. < 300 m above sea level) and closer to the scheme inlet, in conjunction with a good management of nutrients such as nitrogen and potassium through fertilization. © 2023 The Authors",Irrigation performance; Machine learning; Soil property; Sub-Sahara Africa; Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL); Sustainable agriculture,Burkina Faso; Crops; Cultivation; Forestry; Interfacial energy; Irrigation; Nitrogen; Potassium; Remote sensing; Sea level; Zinc; Biophysical factors; Crop water productivity; Irrigation performance; Machine-learning; Soil property; Sub-Sahara Africa; Surface energy balance algorithm for land; Surface energy balance algorithm for lands; Sustainable agriculture; alternative agriculture; altitude; assessment method; climate conditions; evapotranspiration; irrigation system; Landsat; remote sensing; rice; satellite imagery; seasonal variation; semiarid region; soil property; Machine learning,Yes,Yes,remote sensing,climate & meteorology,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Theoretical and empirical models based on remote sensing data have been successfully applied to predict large-scale SWC. However, most existing models are limited to the surface soil layer, while the prediction of SWC in the deep soil layer (1–5 m) has been overlooked because of the shortage of long-term and large-scale filed-observed data. In this study, a south-north transect (ca. 860 km) was selected across the Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP). Based on both long-term remote sensing and in-situ data (2013–2016), pedo-transfer functions (PTFs) for the SWC in the 0–5 m profile were developed using multiple regression, random forest, and artificial neural network. The results showed that evapotranspiration, potential evapotranspiration, soil surface temperature, total shortwave broadband albedo, and normalized difference vegetation index were important remote sensing parameters, whereas soil texture and bulk density were important in-situ parameters for SWC PTFs development. Among the three PTF development methods, machine learning (i.e. random forest and artificial neural network) obtained a higher accuracy than multiple regression. For different combinations of input parameters, the introduction of in-situ factors significantly improved the accuracy of PTFs compared with PTFs based on remote sensing data only. The artificial neural network developed a PTF with only five input variables that predicted SWC with reasonable accuracy (root mean square error = 0.039, R2 = 0.697, mean absolute percentage = 24.8) and is thus useful for many applications on the Loess Plateau of China. In the future, more attention should be given to the role of in-situ parameters when developing PTFs for deep SWC prediction. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Chinese Loess Plateau; Pedo-transfer functions; Remote sensing; Soil water content,China; Loess Plateau; artificial neural network; bulk density; machine learning; NDVI; remote sensing; soil surface; soil texture,Yes,Yes,remote sensing,"climate & meteorology, vegetation indices, soil",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0

Sicily, an insular region of Southern Italy, has exceptionally valuable agricultural production and high irrigation needs. In this study, the ETo reference evapotranspiration in Sicily was first evaluated on the basis of historical and future climate parameters, referring for future values to two climate scenarios characterized by different Representative Concentration Pathways: RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5. Then, the Hierarchical algorithm was used to divide Sicily into three homogeneous regions, each characterized by specific ETo features. In addition, some Machine Learning (ML) algorithms were used to develop forecasting models based on only historical data. Support Vector Regression (SVR) was used to predict the future values of Tmin and Tmax, while an ensemble model based on Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and M5P Regression Tree was developed for the ETo forecasting. Predictions made with the ensemble MLP-M5P model were compared with the ETo computed for the RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 future climate scenarios. During the forecast period, from 2001 to 2091, evapotranspiration increases were observed for all three clusters. For cluster C1, along the coast, percentage increases of 7.52%, 14.64% and 10.78%, were computed for RCP 4.5, RCP 8.5, and MLP-M5P, respectively, while, for cluster C3, in the inland, percentage increases were higher and equal to 8.12%, 16.71%, and 14.98%, respectively. The ensemble MLP-M5P model led to intermediate trends between RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5, showing a high correlation with the latter (R2 between 0.93 and 0.98). The developed approach, based on both clustering and forecasting algorithms, provided a comprehensive analysis of the reference evapotranspiration, with the detection of the different homogeneous regions and, at the same time, the evaluation of the evapotranspiration trends, both in coastal and inland areas. © 2023 The Authors",Artificial Intelligence algorithms; Climate change; Clustering; Ensemble models; Irrigation planning; Mediterranean climate,Italy; Sicily; Climate models; Clustering algorithms; Evapotranspiration; Forecasting; Irrigation; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Water management; Artificial intelligence algorithms; Clusterings; Ensemble models; Homogeneous regions; Irrigation planning; Machine learning algorithms; Mediterranean climates; Model-based OPC; Multilayers perceptrons; Reference evapotranspiration; algorithm; artificial intelligence; climate change; climate effect; evapotranspiration; future prospect; irrigation; trend analysis; Climate change,Yes,Yes,Not Specified,climate & meteorology,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Evapotranspiration (ET) mitigates the urban heat island, reducing the effect of heat waves. It can also be used as a proxy for vegetation water use, making it a crucial tool to plan resilient green cities. To optimize the trade-off between urban greening and water security, reliable and up-to-date maps of ET for cities are urgently needed. Despite its importance, few studies have mapped urban ET accurately for an entire city in high spatial and temporal resolution. We mapped the ET of Berlin, Germany in high spatial (10-m) and temporal (hourly) resolution for the year of 2019. A novel machine learning (ML) approach combining Sentinel-2 time series, open geodata, and flux footprint modeling was applied. Two eddy flux towers with contrasting surrounding land cover provided the training and testing data. Flux footprint modeling allowed us to incorporate comprehensive land cover types in training the ML models. Open remote sensing and geodata used as model inputs included Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from Sentinel-2, building height, impervious surface fraction, vegetation fraction, and vegetation height. NDVI was used to indicate vegetation phenology and health, as plant transpiration contributes to the majority of terrestrial ET. Hourly reference ET (RET) was calculated and used as input to capture the temporal dynamics of the meteorological conditions. Predictions were carried out using Random Forest (RF) regression. Weighted averages extracted from hourly ET maps using flux footprints were compared to measured ET from the two flux towers. Validation showed that the approach is reliable for mapping urban ET, with a mean R2 of 0.76 and 0.56 and a mean RMSE of 0.0289 mm and 0.0171 mm at the more vegetated site and the city-center site, respectively. Lastly, the variation of ET between Local Climate Zones (LCZs) was analyzed to support urban planning. This study demonstrated the capacity to map urban ET at an unprecedented high spatial and temporal resolution with a novel methodology, which can be used to support the sustainable management of green infrastructure and water resources in an urbanizing world facing climate change. © 2023 The Authors",Cooling cities; High resolution; Latent heat flux; Local Climate Zones (LCZs); Nature-based solutions; NDVI; Phenology; Satellite remote sensing; Transpiration; Urban heat island (UHI); Urban planning; Water scarcity,Berlin; Germany; Atmospheric temperature; Economic and social effects; Forestry; Heat flux; Landforms; Remote sensing; Transpiration; Urban planning; Vegetation mapping; Water supply; Cooling city; High resolution; Latent heat flux; Local climate; Local climate zone; Nature-based solution; Normalized difference vegetation index; Phenology; Satellite remote sensing; Urban heat island; Water scarcity; evapotranspiration; heat island; land cover; latent heat flux; NDVI; phenology; remote sensing; trade-off; urban area; urban planning; water management; Evapotranspiration,Yes,Yes,"eddy covariance, weather station, remote sensing","climate & meteorology, vegetation indices",1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0

It is also beneficial to the rational allocation of regional water resources and alleviates the disparity between water supply and demand. This study accurately estimates the ETO of 14 meteorological stations in southern China. Five neural network models (extreme learning machine [ELM], back-propagation neural network [BP], ant colony optimization [ACO]-BP, bird swarm algorithm [BSA]-BP, and cat swarm optimization [CSO]-BP) were introduced to predict ETO with limited factors using different methods. The results demonstrated that models involving T (average, maximum, and minimum air temperature), sunshine duration (n), and relative humidity (RH) exhibited the highest accuracy of all studied combinations; the role of T, n, RH, wind speed (U2) and average atmospheric pressure (AP) regarding ETO gradually decreased. These three biological heuristic algorithms (ACO, BSA, and CSO) each significantly enhanced the capability of the BP model. The accuracy and computational cost of the CSO-BP model are better than those built by other algorithms. Therefore, it is strongly recommended to use the CSO-BP model for ETO estimation in southern China. This result serves as a reference for a more accurate estimation of ETO for future irrigation decision-making and water resource management in southern China. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.",Back-propagation neural network; Hybrid optimization algorithm; K-fold; Reference evapotranspiration; Weather forecast,China; Bioinformatics; Crops; Decision making; Economics; Heuristic algorithms; Machine learning; Molecular dynamics; Neural network models; Soil moisture; Water management; Water supply; Weather forecasting; Wind; Back-propagation neural networks; BP model; Hybrid optimization algorithm; K-fold; Reference crop evapotranspirations; Reference evapotranspiration; Southern China; Swarm optimization; Water resources management; Weather forecast; algorithm; artificial neural network; back propagation; crop production; decision making; evapotranspiration; irrigation; prediction; resource management; water resource; Evapotranspiration,Yes,Yes,weather station,"climate & meteorology, vegetation indices",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0

In establishing the models, the average temperature, maximum temperature, minimum temperature, maximum wind speed, relative humidity, average wind speed, and total precipitation values in the monthly time period were chosen as inputs, and PET values were used as output. The data set is divided into 70% training and 30% testing. 10-fold cross-validation to avoid overfitting problems. Training and test data were randomly selected. The prediction performances of the models were evaluated according to the statistical criteria of determination coefficient (R2), root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and rank analysis. The best PET estimates were obtained using the inputs of mean, min, maximum temperature, relative humidity, total precipitation, average, and maximum wind speed. It was also concluded that XGBoost was the highest performance. When the R2 values were examined, it was seen that the Deep Learning model had higher performance. But for RMSE and MAE, XGBoost did better. As a result of the rank analysis, it was seen that XGBoost got a higher score. © 2023, HARD Publishing Company.

The plants were grown in a growth chamber under recommended conditions and then were exposed to these compounds for 19 days. The uptake of the compounds was measured by sap concentration factor. The plant samples (stem transpiration stream) and solution in the exposure media were taken and analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The plant stem samples were analyzed after a freeze-thaw centrifugation process. The average sap concentration factor for the RDX by tomato, wheat, and corn was 0.71, 0.67, and 0.65. The average sap concentration factor for the exogenous caffeine by tomato, wheat, and corn was 0.72, 0.50, and 0.34.

In this study, we used temperature, humidity, wind speed, air pressure, and solar radiation from a local weather station to forecast potential evapotranspiration (ETo) using machine learning. The Feedforward Neural Network (Multi-Layered Perceptron) algorithm for prediction was used under two approaches: “direct” and “indirect”. In the first one, the ETo is predicted based on historical records, and the second one predicts the climate variables upon which the ETo calculation depends, for which the Penman-Monteith, Hargreaves-Samani, Ritchie, and Turc equations were used. The results were evaluated using statistical criteria to calculate errors, showing remarkable precision, predicting up to 300 days of ETo. Comparing the performance of the approaches and the machine learning used, the results obtained indicate that, despite the similar performance of the two proposed approaches, the indirect approach provides better ETo forecasting capabilities for longer time intervals than the direct approach, whose values of the corresponding metrics are MAE = 0.033, MSE = 0.002, RMSE = 0.043 and RAE = 0.016. © 2022 by the authors.",arid zones; deep learning; evapotranspiration; forecasting; machine learning,,Yes,Yes,"weather station, empirical models",climate & meteorology,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

This study provides an investigation of the performance of 31 widely used empirical equations and 20 models developed using five artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to estimate reference evapotranspiration (ET0) to generate gridded high-resolution daily ET0 estimates over Egypt. The AI algorithms include support vector machine-radial basis function (SVM-RBF), random forest (RF), group method of data handling neural network (GMDH-NN), multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), and dynamic evolving neural fuzzy interference system (DENFIS). Daily observations records of 41 stations distributed over Egypt were used to calculate ET0 using FAO56 Penman–Monteith equation as a reference estimate. The multiparameter Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE) metric was used as an evaluation metric for its robustness in representing different statistical error/agreement characteristics in a single value. By category, the empirical equations based on radiation performed better in replicating FAO56-PM followed by temperature- and mass-transfer-based ones. Ritchie equation was found to be the best overall in Egypt (median KGE 0.76) followed by Caprio (median KGE 0.64), and Penman (median KGE 0.52) equations based on station-wise ranking. On the other hand, the RF model, having maximum and minimum temperatures, wind speed, and relative humidity as predictors, outperformed other AI algorithms. Overall, the RF model performed the best among all the AI models and empirical equations. The generated 0.10° × 0.10° daily estimates of ET0 enabled the detection of a significant increase of 0.12–0.16 mm·decade−1 in the agricultural-dependent Nile Delta using the modified Mann–Kendall test and Sen's slope estimator. © 2022 Royal Meteorological Society.",machine learning; MENA; Penman–Monteith equation; potential evapotranspiration,Egypt; Data handling; Evapotranspiration; Mass transfer; Radial basis function networks; Support vector machines; Water supply; Wind; Artificial intelligence algorithms; Empirical equations; Equation based; High resolution; Intelligence models; Machine-learning; MENA; Penman-Monteith equations; Potential evapotranspiration; Reference evapotranspiration; arid region; artificial intelligence; comparative study; empirical analysis; machine learning; numerical model; Penman-Monteith equation; potential evapotranspiration; Decision trees,Yes,Yes,"weather station, empirical models",climate & meteorology,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

This study introduces an assimilated deep learning neural network to improve the modeling of TWS dynamics. Key predictors and inputs to this deep learning framework include runoff, rainfall, soil moisture, evapotranspiration, global teleconnection patterns and sea surface temperatures (SSTs). The proposed back propagation model in this study capitalizes on the availability of remotely sensed observations and model datasets to predict monthly TWS, a quantity that is difficult to observe in the field, but important for the estimation of regional water budget balance, and water resource management for agricultural purposes. By integrating pre-processed outputs from the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Independent Component Analysis (ICA) into our network using a deep neural pattern, we synthesized TWS from 2002 to 2017, and also made future predictions using our trained models. Results from these analyses showed that the ICA-BPNN model has a higher predictive accuracy compared to the PCA-BPNN. These models (ICA-BPNN and PCA-BPNN) were used to fit the three dominant temporal patterns of Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) – observed TWS over Africa. Our simulation results from the testing phase indicate that the fits for the prediction of the first three leading modes of TWS for both models when compared to the observed GRACE-TWS were PCA-BPNN1 (89%), PCA-BPNN2 (82%), PCA-BPNN3 (84%) and ICA-BPNN1 (93%), ICA-BPNN2 (88%), ICA-BPNN3 (82%). The simulation fit of the BPNN corresponding to multi-annual time series, which are captured in the second and third orthogonal modes and localized patterns of TWS were lower than those of annual signals in both the PCA- and ICA-BPNN models. This was attributed to the fact that the multi-annual time series in GRACE-hydrological signals of our test-bed are complex compared to the annual patterns of TWS. On the one hand, this exemplifies the superior performance of our predictive framework in modeling naturalized system (annual changes in TWS driven by only climatic factors). On the other hand, the complexity in modelling multi-annual variations in TWS suggests heavily disturbed naturalized systems evidenced in the presence of human water management operations among other anthropogenic activities. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",BPNN; Deep learning; Neural Network; Nino 3.4; Terrestrial water storage,Africa; Backpropagation; Budget control; Climate models; Complex networks; Deep neural networks; Forecasting; Independent component analysis; Learning systems; Oceanography; Soil moisture; Surface waters; Time series; Water management; Annual time series; BPNN; Deep learning; Global climates; Gravity recovery and climate experiments; Independent components analysis; Neural-networks; Nino 3.4; Principal-component analysis; Terrestrial water storage; GRACE; Principal component analysis,Yes,Yes,Not Specified,"climate & meteorology, vegetation indices, soil",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0

But the deficiency of long-term, on-site records and limited observation stations is a critical challenge in determining the veracity of these variables. The GWET and BWET estimations rely considerably on extensive climate data, water fluxes data, soil parameters, crop distribution, and crop management data. However, obtaining accurate data by on-site observations or by remote sensing products is a difficult task in a data-scarce region and fewer variables are not sufficient to empirically estimate GWET and BWET. Machine learning (ML) is a modern artificial intelligence decision-making tool based on the analysis of fed-data and computer algorithms. This study reported the enormous potential of ML algorithms for estimating BWET and GWET using different sets of available climate variables. Wheat crop BWET and GWET were estimated at 114 meteorological stations in the Amu-Darya River Basin (ADRB) in Central Asia, using four most widely used ML algorithms: artificial neural network (ANN), supported vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and k-nearest neighbor (KNN). ML algorithms were trained with 75 % of the data, while tested and validated with 25 % of the data. A set of 24 models of different unique combinations of available variables were attempted to reasonably estimate GWET and BWET, and satisfying results were achieved. RF was found to be the most-promising ML algorithm to estimate BWET and GWET with limited available climate data. The estimated BWET and GWET can be considered in agriculture water resources policies to minimize further risks to the agroecosystem in ADRB. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Amu Darya River Basin; Blue water evapotranspiration; Data scarcity; Green water evapotranspiration; Machine learning,Amu Darya Basin; Central Asia; Crops; Decision trees; Learning algorithms; Meteorology; Nearest neighbor search; Neural networks; Remote sensing; Risk perception; Rivers; Support vector machines; Watersheds; Amu darya river basin; Blue water; Blue water evapotranspiration; Central Asia; Data scarcity; Green water; Green water evapotranspiration; Machine learning algorithms; Machine-learning; River basins; algorithm; artificial intelligence; artificial neural network; estimation method; evapotranspiration; machine learning; meteorology; Evapotranspiration,Yes,Yes,"weather station, remote sensing","climate & meteorology, vegetation indices",0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0

In this study, SVM, RF, and ANN machine learning algorithms were tested to forecast the monthly storage rate of agricultural reservoirs. The storage rate observed over 30 years (1991–2022) was set as a label, and nine datasets for a one- to three-month storage rate forecast were constructed using precipitation and evapotranspiration as features. In all, 70% of the total data was used for training and validation, and the remaining 30% was used as a test. The one-month storage rate forecasting showed that all SVM, RF, and ANN algorithms were highly reliable, with R2 values ≥ 0.8. As a result of the storage rate forecast for two and three months, the ANN and SVM algorithms showed relatively reasonable explanatory power with an average R2 of 0.64 to 0.69, but the RF algorithm showed a large generalization error. The results of comparing the learning time showed that the learning speed was the fastest in the order of SVM, RF, and ANN algorithms in all of the one to three months. Overall, the learning performance of SVM and ANN algorithms was better than RF. The SVM algorithm is the most credible, with the lowest error rates and the shortest training time.

The FAO Penman-Monteith (FAO-PM56) was used as the reference method and four empirical methods (Hargreaves, Thornthwaite, Cenicafé, and Turc) were assessed with five metrics to evaluate the method of best fit to FAO-PM56, root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), mean bias error (MBE), Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient (NSE), and Pearson correlation coefficient (R). Three models were designed using machine learning techniques to estimate ETo, multiple linear regression (MLR), artificial neural networks (ANN), and autoregressive integrated moving average model (ARIMA). The results showed that the ARIMA-M3 model reported the best performance metrics (RMSE = 4.13 mm month-1, MAE = 3.15 mm month-1, MBE = -0.08 mm month-1, NSE = 0.96 and r = 0.98). However, it restricts in that it can only be used locally and cannot be extrapolated to other climatological stations, because it was calibrated with specific conditions (exogenous variables) and stations, unlike the ANN-M1 model, which only requires training the network for its application. This method will allow estimating ETo in places with scarce information, as vital for water management in places with much uncertainty regarding accessibility and availability. © (2023), (Centro Argentino de Meteorologos).

In this paper, we use the basic principles of hydrological modelling to develop a model for the exploitation of rainfall in reservoir basins in the province of Malaga, Spain. The monthly water input data of the seven reservoirs in the province of Malaga, provided by the Hidrosur Network of the Automatic Hydrological Information System (SAIH), as well as the precipitation and daily temperature of the stations of the State Meteorological Agency (AEMET) associated with the basins of each of these reservoirs were used. We assume that the entrance to a reservoir in a given month must depend on the precipitation produced in its watershed (both the amount of rain and the intensity with which it fell), the precipitation collected from the previous months (and the way in which it was produced) and the evapotranspiration produced during that period. For each reservoir, we propose a model with nine parameters to simulate the arrival of rainfall to the reservoir, covering aspects from the amount and intensity of rain, past and present, to the level of evapotranspiration on a given area for a given date. These nine parameters are optimally adjusted through an artificial intelligence algorithm to maximize the correlation between real and simulated contributions. The results show how this model, adjusted for each reservoir, will let us predict how changes in the rainfall and temperature patterns, predicted, for example, by the IPCC models, will affect the future water levels at the studied reservoirs. © The Author(s) 2023.",artificial intelligence; exploitation; parametric adjustment; Reservoirs; soil hydrology; useful water,,Yes,Yes,weather station,"climate & meteorology, vegetation indices",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0

Rainfall displays variability whereas reference crop evapotranspiration is nonlinear dynamic and complex phenomena. Reference crop evapotranspiration is an important component in calculation of crop water requirements, climatological and hydrological studies. In the present study, eight independent models are developed by using widely employed artificial intelligence (AI) formalism, namely, multilayer perceptron-artificial neural network (MLP-ANN). The proposed models predict two important weather parameters, viz. rainfall and reference crop evapotranspiration (ETo) using meteorological data of 34 calendar years (1983–2016) at Dapoli, District Ratnagiri, Maharashtra, India. The input space of the models consists of six climatic variables, namely, maximum temperature (Tmax), minimum temperature (Tmin), maximum relative humidity (RHmax), minimum relative humidity (RHmin), wind speed (WS), and sunshine duration (SSD). The high correlation coefficient (CC) values (0.900 to 0.957), and low root mean square error (RMSE) values (0.543 to 22.057) for both training along with test data set indicate very good prediction accuracy and generalization performance of the proposed models.

Hydrologic modelling has emerged as a potential solution for understanding watershed responses to projected climate change, and a prediction model that can deliver actionable information is necessary, although it requires basin-scale observations to calibrate the model to reliably predict basin-scale water resources hazards. Such luxury is not always tenable in watersheds with inadequate ground-based observation. However, satellite-based evapotranspiration (ET) data coupled with a machine learning feature selection as a data refinement process has made integrated water balance modelling widely regarded as a viable alternative for improving the capability of watershed modelling processes in data-sparse regions. This study developed a convincing hydrologic model framework to sufficiently calibrate and provide accurate behavioural solutions for all model responses. The framework was applied to four sub-basins that form the larger Lake Chad basin. The model results were applied to assess the dynamic changes in projected blue and green water resource sustainability in response to climate change in one of the sub-basins. Study findings indicate that hydrologic fluxes can be simulated accurately with varying degrees of acceptability, with R2 and NSE values in the range of 0.69–0.88 and 0.45–0.77 for calibration and 0.69–0.79 and 0.34–0.63 for validation, respectively, and captured within a satisfactory uncertainty range of P-factor and R-factor values of 0.68–0.93 and 0.73–1.31, respectively, in 83%, 67%, 85.7%, and 81.3% of the sub-watersheds based on multi-site simulation despite distinct watershed morphology, although there are significant trade-offs in parameter sensitivity. Whilst green water is the dominant freshwater component across the basin relative to blue water, climate change may be a significant factor influencing changes in the projected green water sustainability status, and the combination of socioeconomic drivers and climate change may significantly impact the projected blue water sustainability status across the basin. Projected changes in the green and blue water sustainability status have shown that more than 50% of the watershed will become ecologically fragile. In addition, the identified freshwater geographic sustainability hotspots may be beyond restoration without adequate long-term river basin water resource plans.

For this purpose, four main driving forces: air temperature, air humidity, solar radiation, and wind speed need to be measured over the well-watered reference grass. The relative influence of these driving forces is region and climate-specific, with daily and seasonal variations. A clear understanding of the dynamic interactions of ETo's driving factors can illuminate the water and energy cycles of the earth and assist modelers with more accurate predictions of ETo. In this study, Pearson correlation, mutual information, and random forest feature importance analyses have been used to evaluate the relative importance of meteorological driving forces of ETo in California. To better understand the interrelations of these variables, 1,365,823 daily data samples from 237 standardized weather stations for 36 years have been clustered into homogeneous climatic zones and analyzed. To compensate for the effects of seasonality, feature importance analysis is also conducted on seasonal and monthly clustered data. Moreover, seasonal and annual trends of ETo and its driving factors are investigated for California and homogeneous zones using the Mann-Kendall test. Our findings reveal that for annually clustered data, solar radiation is the most influential driving factor of ETo in California. However, analysis of seasonal and monthly clustered data shows that vapor pressure deficit is the most informative factor during the summer and spring, while solar radiation is more important during the colder seasons. Results of trend analysis don't suggest a consistent monotonic trend for ETo and other variables for different seasons and zones. However, it is shown that agricultural regions with heavy irrigation dependence like the Central Valley are getting warmer and drier, especially during the irrigation season. This can adversely affect the water resources, agriculture industry, and food production of California, and modeling efforts like this can be very informative for future water resources management. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Feature importance analysis; Mann-Kendall test; Mutual information; Pearson correlation; Random Forest; Reference evapotranspiration,Poaceae; Seasons; Temperature; Water; Weather; Wind; California; Central Valley [California]; United States; Atmospheric humidity; Atmospheric pressure; Correlation methods; Decision trees; Evapotranspiration; Solar radiation; Wind; water; California; Driving factors; Driving forces; Feature importance analyse; Importance analysis; Mann-Kendall test; Mutual informations; Pearson correlation; Random forests; Reference evapotranspiration; air temperature; correlation; evapotranspiration; grass; humidity; machine learning; meteorology; seasonal variation; solar radiation; trend analysis; wind velocity; Article; California; case study; evapotranspiration; food industry; irrigation (agriculture); meteorological phenomena; seasonal variation; solar radiation; spring; summer; trend study; water supply; Poaceae; season; temperature; weather; wind; Irrigation,Yes,Yes,weather station,"climate & meteorology, vegetation indices",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0

However, it is necessary to explore an alternative model to estimate ET0 concisely because of numerous limitations in the Penman–Monteith method. To improve the ET0 estimation accuracy using limited meteorological data, this study developed a novel hybrid deep learning model (D–LSTM) based on the meteorological data during 1961–2020 observed at fifty stations on the Loess Plateau, which used the Deep Belief Network (DBN) module to extract features from meteorological data and the Long Short–Term Memory (LSTM) module to expand time features and process data information with sequential features, respectively. Based on the comparative evaluation of ET0 estimation accuracy between the D–LSTM, DBN, LSTM, and nine empirical models, the results drawn from this study demonstrated that the D–LSTM model manifested the best performance as RH–based, Rn–based, and T–based ET0 estimating models. For local strategy, the value of R2, NSE, RMSE, MAPE, and GPI ranging 0.941 ± 0.020, 0.940 ± 0.032, 0.436 ± 0.457 mm d–1, 0.150 ± 0.016, and 1.611 ± 0.180 for D–LSTM1 (RH–based), 0.944 ± 0.030, 0.943 ± 0.037, 0.423 ± 0.313 mm d–1, 0.119 ± 0.013, and 1.917 ± 0.155 for D–LSTM2 (Rn–based), and 0.902 ± 0.091, 0.891 ± 0.094, 0.558 ± 0.319 mm d–1, 0.181 ± 0.058, and 1.440 ± 0.550 for D–LSTM3 (T–based). For external strategy, the average value of R2, NSE, RMSE, MAPE, and GPI were 0.874, 0.872, 0.651 mm d–1, 0.159, and 1.837 for D–LSTM1, 0.894, 0.892, 0.591 mm d–1, 0.138, and 2.000 for D–LSTM2, and 0.839, 0.827, 0.768 mm d–1, 0.212, and 1.482 for D–LSTM3. Following, the LSTM performed better than DBN for local strategy, but vice versa for external strategy. Despite DL models outperforming RH–based and Rn–based empirical models, H[sbnd]S outperformed the DBN3 for local strategy, and was superior to LSTM3 for external strategy. Under limited meteorological data, the Rn–based ET0 estimating models are superior to RH–based and T–based models, and RH–based achieved better accuracy than T–based for DL models, but vice versa for empirical models. There is significant spatial variability in the accuracy of daily ET0 models, but the high precision of the D–LSTM was stable on the Loess Plateau. Overall, the D–LSTM model, which combines the advantages of DBN and LSTM, is the most recommended ET0 model using incomplete meteorological data on the Loess Plateau, which is very helpful for farmers or irrigation system operators to improve their irrigation scheduling. © 2022",Deep Belief Network; Empirical model; Hybrid deep learning model; K–fold cross validation; Long Short–Term Memory,China; Loess Plateau; Brain; Crops; Evapotranspiration; Learning systems; Meteorology; Deep belief networks; Empirical model; Hybrid deep learning model; K fold cross validations; Learning models; Local strategies; Loess Plateau; Memory modeling; Meteorological data; Reference evapotranspiration; accuracy assessment; empirical analysis; estimation method; evapotranspiration; hydrological modeling; machine learning; model validation; Penman-Monteith equation; Long short-term memory,Yes,Yes,"weather station, empirical models",climate & meteorology,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

On the other hand, few studies in arid regions have reported high root-mean square error (RMSE) values. However, these regions make an important contribution to agricultural production, and thus, water management of these regions is crucial. It motivated the implementation of such a study in an arid environment of Karaj, Iran, as a case study, in order to estimate daily ET0 with as much accuracy as possible. To achieve this purpose, the performance of 21 known models estimating ET0, including 9 empirical models and 12 machine learning (ML) models, were evaluated. The method provided by the food and agriculture organization (FAO) known as FAO-56 Penman-Monteith (FPM) was regarded as the main reference method for measuring ET0. A new climate data set related to the period of 2005-2020 (April-September) was used to calibrate and cross-validate models. In fact, this study intended to develop an approach for simulating day-to-day variations in ET0 in arid environments by benefitting minimal weather data (i.e., temperature, humidity, and wind speed) for practical purposes because most regions suffer from a lack of weather data, especially radiation data. Therefore, the performance of the best models calibrated in Karaj station was also validated based on data recorded in a research field with a similar climate during 2020-2021. The cross-validated results showed that the deep-learning (DL) model had the lowest RMSE as well as the highest R2 compared with other models. As averaged over all months in Karaj, the DL model exhibited a RMSE 64% less than the best-calibrated empirical model (i.e., Valiantzas-VTS), which is a solar radiation-based model. Furthermore, the improvements arising from using the DL model were more considerable in the extremes than in the middle values. The findings of the field research also demonstrated that the approach developed in the current study would be beneficial at locations other than the calibration station. This approach requires few inputs, is independent of solar radiation data, and also has the lowest RMSE compared with that of other studies.

ETa data with high accuracy are of great significance to the understanding of hydrological processes and the regulation of local climate. In this paper, an ETa product with hourly temporal resolution for the entire Tibetan Plateau (TP) was proposed by using Fengyun-4A geostationary satellite data and a random forest (RF) model. Validation between RF-based ETa and in situ observations from six eddy-covariance stations over the TP showed a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.991 mm day−1. Compared with the ETa results from the surface energy balance system (SEBS), maximum entropy production (MEP) and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis Fifth Generation (ERA5) with RMSE values of 1.997 mm day−1, 2.182 mm day−1 and 1.555 mm day−1, respectively, the RF model showed the best performance. The annual RF-based ETa over the entire TP was approximately 365.60 mm. Thus, the total water amount evapotranspired from the TP surface was approximately 9811.01×108 t yr−1. Additionally, diurnal, monthly and seasonal ETa variations in different land cover types and climate zones over the TP and their contributions to the total ETa were clearly quantified. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Actual evapotranspiration; Fengyun-4A; Machine learning; Random forest regression; Tibetan Plateau,China; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau; Entropy; Evapotranspiration; Geostationary satellites; Machine learning; Mean square error; Random forests; Weather forecasting; Actual evapotranspiration; Fengyun-4a; Global energy; Machine-learning; Multisource data; Random forest modeling; Random forest regression; Random forests; Root mean square errors; Tibetan Plateau; accuracy assessment; climate modeling; estimation method; evapotranspiration; FengYun; geostationary satellite; machine learning; plateau; regression analysis; seasonal variation; weather forecasting; Decision trees,Yes,Yes,remote sensing,"climate & meteorology, vegetation indices",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0

The possible feedback to a national real-time risk knowledge base during extreme events (flooding and drought) is also discussed. Under climate change conditions, Denmark is likely to experience more rain in winter, more evapotranspiration in summer, intensified cloudbursts, drought, and sea level rise. These challenges were addressed as part of the Joint Governmental Digitalization Strategy 2016–2020 for better use and sharing of public data about the terrain, water, and climate to support climate adaptation, water management, and disaster risk reduction. This initiative included the development of a new web-based data portal (HIP portal) developed by the Danish Agency for Data Supply and Infrastructure (SDFI).

The input data consist of monthly solar radiation (Rs), maximum air temperature (Tmax), and wind speed (Ws) derived from 163 meteorological stations in Turkey. Different input combinations were created and analyzed. The model’s performance was evaluated using criteria such as Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency, Kling-Gupta efficiency, relative root mean squared error, mean absolute percentage error, and determination coefficient. Moreover, Taylor, radar, and boxplot diagrams were created. It was determined that the MGGP model outperformed both the M5Tree and the KNN models. The equation obtained from the MGGP model, for the best-performed combination of Rs-Tmax-Ws, was presented. The best weather conditions were obtained as 0.029 to 31.814 MJ/m2, − 5.8 to 45.7 °C, and 0.140 to 5.086 m/s for Rs, Tmax, and Ws, respectively. It was also found that the Rs was the most potent input variable for ET0 estimation while Ws was the weakest. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",K-nearest neighbor algorithm; M5 model trees; Multi-gene genetic programming; Reference evapotranspiration; Turkiye,Environmental Monitoring; Machine Learning; Meteorology; Turkey; Wind; Turkey; Efficiency; Evapotranspiration; Forestry; Genes; Genetic programming; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Mean square error; Meteorology; Motion compensation; Nearest neighbor search; Trees (mathematics); Wind; Genetic programming modeling; K-near neighbor algorithm; M5 model tree; Machine learning methods; Multi-gene genetic programming; Nearest-neighbor algorithms; Predictive power; Reference evapotranspiration; Turkiye; Wind speed; algorithm; evapotranspiration; machine learning; prediction; temperature anomaly; air temperature; algorithm; article; evapotranspiration; genetic model; k nearest neighbor; machine learning; prediction; root mean squared error; solar radiation; telecommunication; Turkey (republic); weather; wind speed; environmental monitoring; meteorology; turkey (bird); wind; Genetic algorithms,Yes,Yes,weather station,climate & meteorology,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Using empirical relationships between environmental factors and SOC stocks to evaluate land models can help modelers understand prediction biases beyond what can be achieved with the observed SOC stocks alone. In this study, we used 31 observed environmental factors, field SOC observations (n = 6,213) from the continental United States, and two machine learning approaches (random forest [RF] and generalized additive modeling [GAM]) to (a) select important environmental predictors of SOC stocks, (b) derive empirical relationships between environmental factors and SOC stocks, and (c) use the derived relationships to predict SOC stocks and compare the prediction accuracy of simpler model developed with the machine learning predictions. Out of the 31 environmental factors we investigated, 12 were identified as important predictors of SOC stocks by the RF approach. In contrast, the GAM approach identified six (of those 12) environmental factors as important controllers of SOC stocks: potential evapotranspiration, normalized difference vegetation index, soil drainage condition, precipitation, elevation, and net primary productivity. The GAM approach showed minimal SOC predictive importance of the remaining six environmental factors identified by the RF approach. Our derived empirical relations produced comparable prediction accuracy to the GAM and RF approach using only a subset of environmental factors. The empirical relationships we derived using the GAM approach can serve as important benchmarks to evaluate environmental control representations of SOC stocks in ESMs, which could reduce uncertainty in predicting future carbon–climate feedbacks. © 2022 The Authors.

The present study aims to evaluate the performances of two stochastic and machine learning models in predicting ET0 for Mazandaran province, which is one of the most important centers of rice cultivation (as a high-water use plant) in Iran. The studied data belong to 5 synoptic stations in Mazandaran province. They include minimum, maximum, and mean air temperature, minimum, maximum, and mean relative humidity, wind speed, and sunshine duration. These data are received on a daily basis from the Iranian Meteorological Organization during the period 2003–2018. Then, these variables and the FAO-56 Penman-Monteith model are used to calculate daily ET0 rates. Moreover, stochastic models including autoregressive (AR), moving average (MA), autoregressive moving average (ARMA), and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), and machine learning models including least square support vector machine (LSSVM), adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), and generalized regression neural network (GRNN) are used to predict ET0. Predictor inputs include ET0 time lags selected by Autocorrelation Function (ACF) and partial ACF (PACF). The time series models of ARMA and ARIMA, and the machine learning model of LSSVM provide the most accurate predictions with the slight superiority of ARMA and ARIMA over LSSVM in most cases. As a result, it is found that stochastic models are superior to machine learning models due to their more accurate prediction and less complexity. The ARMA model (root mean square error = 0.623mmday, Wilmott index = 0.962, and R2 = 86.22%) shows the highest prediction accuracy. The current approach can be applied to predict irrigation water requirements and has research value under similar or different climatic conditions. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",ANFIS; ARIMA; ARMA; Daily evapotranspiration prediction; GRNN; LSSVM,Iran; Mazandaran; Crops; Cultivation; Evapotranspiration; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy neural networks; Fuzzy systems; Irrigation; Mean square error; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Support vector machines; Water supply; Wind speed; Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference; Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system; Auto-regressive; Autoregressive integrated moving average; Autoregressive/moving averages; Daily evapotranspiration prediction; Daily evapotranspirations; Generalized regression; Generalized regression neural network; Least square support vector machines; Moving averages; Neuro-fuzzy inference systems; Regression neural networks; comparative study; evapotranspiration; humid environment; machine learning; performance assessment; prediction; stochasticity; Forecasting,Yes,Yes,"weather station, empirical models",climate & meteorology,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

It represents an important input for numerous tasks, such as crop growth, development, yield, and irrigation scheduling, to name a few. Advances in technology allow collecting this weather data from heterogeneous sources with high temporal resolution and at low cost. Generating and using these data in their raw form makes no sense, and therefore implementing adequate infrastructure and tools is necessary. For that purpose, this paper presents a smart weather data management system evaluated using data from a meteorological station installed in our study area covering the period from 2013 to 2020 at a half-hourly scale. The proposed system makes use of state-of-the-art statistical methods, machine learning, and deep learning models to derive actionable insights from these raw data. The general architecture is made up of four layers: data acquisition, data storage, data processing, and application layers. The data sources include real-time sensors, IoT devices, reanalysis data, and raw files. The data are then checked for errors and missing values using a proposed method based on ERA5-Land reanalysis data and deep learning. The resulting coefficient of determination (R2) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) for this method were 0.96 and 0.04, respectively, for the scaled air temperature estimate. The MongoDB NoSQL database is used for storage thanks to its ability to deal with real-world big data. The system offers various services such as (i) weather time series forecasts, (ii) visualization and analysis of meteorological data, and (iii) the use of machine learning to estimate the reference evapotranspiration (ET0) needed for efficient irrigation. To this, the platform uses the XGBoost model to achieve the precision of the Penman–Monteith method while using a limited number of meteorological variables (air temperature and global solar radiation). Results for this approach give R2 = 0.97 and RMSE = 0.07.

Therefore, this study proposed SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values to address the problem of the interpretability of the output of the support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), convolutional neural network (CNN), and long short-term memory (LSTM) models to forecast climatic water balance (CWB) within 1–3 months lead-time. The current study uses two Koppen–Geiger climate zones over Bangladesh: the humid subtropical climate with dry winter and hot summer (Cwa) and the tropical climate (Af-Am). Monthly antecedent CWB, potential evapotranspiration (PET), convective available potential energy (CAPE), relative humidity (RH), air temperature (TEM), El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO), Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), and North Atlantic oscillation (NAO) are used as the inputs to the proposed model. SHAP values show that CWB (current month) for both climate zones has the maximum impact on the prediction. The effects of atmospheric variables and ocean–atmospheric teleconnections on CWB forecasts over Bangladesh are low. Forecasting results show that the SVM model shows the best performance for CWB forecasts in the Cwa and Af-Am climate zones in terms of antecedent CWB as input. And this model effectively decreases the negative effect of increasing forecast lead-time. Since the proposed model can predict CWB in 3-months lead-time, it would help policy-makers and practitioners to reduce the drought and flood impacts in the future by adopting better preparedness plans. © 2022 Royal Meteorological Society.",climatic water balance; feature importance; machine learning; SHapley Additive exPlanations; support vector machine,Bangladesh; Atmospheric humidity; Atmospheric pressure; Climate models; Climatology; Decision trees; Forecasting; Learning systems; Long short-term memory; Potential energy; Support vector regression; Tropics; 'current; Bangladesh; Climatic water balance; Feature importance; Leadtime; Learning models; Machine-learning; Shapley; Shapley additive explanation; Support vectors machine; climate change; machine learning; seasonal variation; support vector machine; teleconnection; water budget; Additives,Yes,Yes,weather station,climate & meteorology,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

In this sense, we evaluate six machine learning approaches to estimate the reference and actual evapotranspiration (ET0 and ETa) through CERES satellite products data. The results obtained applying machine learning techniques were compared with values obtained from ground-based information. After training and validating the algorithms, we observed that Support Vector machine-based Regressor (SVR) showed the best accuracy. Then, with an independent dataset, the calibrated SVR were tested. For predicting the reference evapotranspiration, we observed statistical errors of MAE = 0.437 mm d−1, and RMSE = 0.616 mm d−1, with a determination coefficient, R2, of 0.893. Regarding actual evapotranspiration modelling, we observed statistical errors of MAE = 0.422 mm d−1, and RMSE = 0.599 mm d−1, with a R2of 0.614. Comparing the results obtained with the machine learning models developed another studies in the same field, we understand that the results are promising and represent a baseline for future studies.

Early detection of this disease is critical in informing growers to apply management measures to reduce Verticillium wilt incidence and severity. However, early detection of V. dahliae can be challenging due to the cryptic nature of its symptom emergence and expression. This paper presents the implementation of near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy coupled with machine learning to develop an efficient and objective tool for the early detection of Verticillium wilt in potato plants. Two artificial neural network (ANN) models were developed using the raw absorbance values within the 1596 – 2396 nm light spectral range as inputs to predict photosynthetic rate (A), transpiration rate (E), and stomatal conductance (gs), as well as predict whether plants were infected or non-infected. The results showed high accuracy for Model 1 (R = 0.89 using all samples from trial 1) with a deployment accuracy of R = 0.76 using all samples from trial 2. High accuracy was also obtained for Model 2 using samples from trial 1 (94 %) with a deployment accuracy of 84 % using samples from trial 2. Results showed that V. dahliae presence could correctly be identified in plants two days after inoculation (DAI) without any visible symptomatology. These model types have never been presented for Verticillium wilt of potato and show high potential in introducing a cost-effective, efficient, and user-friendly means for growers to detect Verticillium wilt before symptoms occur. © 2022",Artificial neural networks; Chemical fingerprint; Fungal disease; Plant disease modeling; Plant physiology,Chemical detection; Cost effectiveness; Diagnosis; Infrared devices; Machine learning; Near infrared spectroscopy; Plants (botany); Chemical fingerprint; Disease models; Fungal disease; High-accuracy; Machine learning models; Plant disease; Plant disease modeling; Plant physiology; Verticillium dahliae; Verticillium wilt; artificial neural network; fungal disease; host-pathogen interaction; machine learning; stomatal conductance; Neural networks,Yes,Yes,Not Specified,plant physiology,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

However, hybrid MAs are quite scarcely used to predict ETo in the existing literature. To this end, the prediction abilities of two support vector regression (SVR) models coupled with three types of MAs including particle swarm optimization (PSO), grey wolf optimization (GWO), and gravitational search algorithm (GSA) were studied and compared with single SVR and SVR-PSO in predicting monthly ETo using meteorological variables as inputs. Data obtained from Rajshahi, Bogra, and Rangpur stations in the humid region, northwestern Bangladesh, was used for this purpose as a case study. The prediction precision of the proposed models was trained and tested using nine input combinations and assessed using root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE). The tested results revealed that the SVR-PSOGWO model outperformed the other applied soft computing models in predicting ETo in all input combinations, followed by the SVR-PSOGSA, SVR-PSO, and SVR. It was found that SVR-PSOGWO decreases the RMSE of SVR, SVR-PSO, and SVR-PSOGSA by 23%, 27%, 14%, 21%, 19%, and 5% in Rangpur and Bogra stations during the testing stage. The RMSE of the SVR, SVR-PSO, and SVR-PSOGSA reduced by 32%, 20%, and 3%, respectively, employing the SVR-PSOGWO for the Rajshahi Station.

Therefore, it is important to predict the sap flow to analyze the amount of tree transpiration for assessing of water consumption. In this paper, we propose a new sap flow assessment using environmental factors based on a convolutional neural network-gated recurrent unit (CGRU) hybrid deep learning method. The model was trained and tested with the sap flow and environmental factors from 17,568 group observations from public SAPFLUXNET dataset. These group observations measured from January 1, 2012 to December 31, 2012, with acquisition interval of 30 min for one tree of New Zealand Agathis australis. After designed the CGRU structure by integrated a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a gated recurrent unit (GRU) neural network, the input variables were selected with a correlation analysis between sap flow and environmental factors. Additionally, the number of previous conditions were introduced into the input of the model. Results showed that when the number of previous conditions set to 16, the learning rate set to 0.01 with Adam optimization algorithm, the mean squared error, mean absolute percentage error, and coefficient of determination of the CGRU model were 0.00231, 22.31 and 0.948 respectively. Comparing results showed that the CGRU-based sap flow prediction model has more accuracy than other eight models participating in the test including the independent CNN, GRU, CNN-Long short-term memory (LSTM) and five traditional machine learning based models. The least time spent on training is also the CGRU model. The CGRU-based sap flow prediction model proposed in this paper can capture complex nonlinear dependencies and yield accurate assessments of sap flow.

This paper proposed and tested a procedure to estimate sap flow by calculating global radiation in a digital model of the tree canopy surface obtained by unmanned aerial vehicle imaging. The sap flow of nine trees was continuously measured in the field. In the digital surface model, individual canopies were automatically delineated, their parameters were determined and the global radiation incident on their surface on specific days was calculated. A polynomial relationship was found between sap flow and the calculated incident solar radiation during the morning hours with a coeﬃcient of determination of 0.98, as well as a linear relationship between the decrease in radiation and sap flow during the afternoon with a correlation coeﬃcient of 0.99. Using the Random Forest machine learning method, a model predicting the sap flow of the trees was created based on the global radiation and canopy parameters determined from the digital surface model of tree canopies. The resulting model was deployed on additional days and compared to field measurements of sap flow, achieving a correlation coeﬃcient of 0.918. In addition, two linear regression models were created for a tree group, achieving coeﬃcients of determination of 0.66 and 0.90. © The authors.

To better understand the impact of these changes, it is crucial to analyze the dynamics of climate variables and evapotranspiration (ETo), a critical climate variable. This study aimed to model ETo rates considering climate change scenarios in the Brazilian Semi-arid region (BSR). The modeling was based on tests of five machine learning algorithms: Bayesian Regularized Neural Networks (BRNN), Cubist, Earth, Linear Regression (LM), and Random Forest (RF). A dataset with 20 covariates was used to represent the current scenario. In the future prediction, covariates from two shared socio-economic pathways were used (SSPs 126 and 585). The best statistical performance was achieved by Cubist (R² = 0.98 and RMSE = 0.08 mm day-¹ in the holdout-test). The current daily average ETo is 4.77 mm day-¹, while in future scenarios, it can increase by 3.56% in SSP 126 and 15.51% in SSP 585. ETo rates are expected to expand territorially; ranges from > 0.60 mm day-¹ should increase 8% in SSP 126 and 40% in SSP 585. The applied model suggests that ETo may increase in future scenarios in the BSR, which could affect biodiversity levels and intensify social conflicts. © 2023, Universidade Federal de Pernambuco.

Drip irrigation plays an important role in improving water and fertilization utilization efficiency and ensuring crop production in arid areas. Accurate prediction of soil salinity and crop evapotranspiration under drip irrigation is essential to guide water management practices in arid and saline areas. However, traditional hydrological models such as Hydrus require more variety of input parameters and user expertise, which limits its application in practice, and machine learning (ML) provides a potential alternative. Based on a global dataset collected from 134 pieces of literature, we proposed a method to comprehensively simulate soil salinity, evapotranspiration (ET) and cotton yield. Results showed that it was recommended to predict soil salinity, crop evapotranspiration and cotton yield based on soil data (bulk density), meteorological factors, irrigation data and other data. Among them, meteorological factors include annual average temperature, total precipitation, year. Irrigation data include salinity in irrigation water, soil matric potential and irrigation water volume, while other data include soil depth, distance from dripper, days after sowing (for EC and soil salinity), fertilization rate (for yield and ET). The accuracy of the model has reached a satisfactory level, R2 in 0.78-0.99. The performance of stacking ensemble ML was better than that of a single model, i.e., gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT); random forest (RF); extreme gradient boosting regression (XGBR), with R2 increased by 0.02%-19.31%. In all input combinations, other data have a greater impact on the model accuracy, while the RMSE of the S1 scenario (input without meteorological factors) without meteorological data has little difference, which is -34.22%~19.20% higher than that of full input. Given the wide application of drip irrigation in cotton, we recommend the application of ensemble ML to predict soil salinity and crop evapotranspiration, thus serving as the basis for adjusting the irrigation schedule.

The results show that: ① When the ET0values calculated by PM and HS formula are taken as the standard, the relationship between the accuracy of ET0 simulation by the three machine learning algorithms is: GPR > SVM > SL. The GPR algorithm has the highest simulation accuracy, and its correlation coefficient (R2) ranges from 0.950 to 0.995. ② When the same machine learning algorithm is adopted, the R2 range of ET0 calculated by PM is 0.965~0.995, the RMSE range is 0.212~0.260 and the MAE range is 0.151~0.201. When HS formula is used as the reference value, the R2 range is 0.935~0.984, the RMSE range is 0.832~0.964, and the MAE range is 0.596~0.745. ③ In different climatic zones, the accuracy of ET0 simulated by machine learning algorithm in arid zone is better than that in humid zone, and its R2 is increased by 0.01, when taking the calculation results of the same reference formula as the standard. ④ Comparing the robustness of different machine learning algorithms, SL and SVM algorithms have the highest robustness when taking the calculation results of PM and HS formula as the reference value respectively, and the variation range of R2 from training to simulation stage is only 0.16% and 0.11%, while GPR algorithm has the lowest robustness. ⑤ Compared with the training time cost of different machine learning algorithms, the computational cost of SVM and GPR algorithm is significantly higher than that of SL algorithm. Based on the comprehensive analysis of ET0 prediction accuracy, robustness and calculation cost of the three algorithms, SVM algorithm can be recommended as a more accurate method for predicting reference crop evapotranspiration in arid and humid areas of China. Moreover, the quatitative relationship between the accuracy of machine learning simulation and meteorological factors shows that the change of sunshine hours (N) is the main factor affecting the prediction accuracy of each algorithm. © 2022 Editorial Office Of Water Saving Irrigation.

Irrigation is a key factor in walnut cultivation and its most important problem is related to accurately estimating the need for irrigation water. Walnut water use was estimated in this study through artificial intelligence methods, namely artificial neural networks (ANN) and the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) using meteorological data in western Turkey, which has semi-arid climatic conditions. Probabilistic scenarios based on maximum, minimum and average temperature, wind speed and sunshine hours over the period 2016-2019 were developed and tested with ANN and ANFIS to estimate walnut evapotranspiration. Results indicate that the optimum performance in the training and testing for ANN and ANFIS was obtained from the fourth scenario with R = 0.95 and two climate parameters: sunshine duration and mean temperature. Both ANN and ANFIS were able to predict crop water use obtaining a high correlation and the minimum number of climatic parameters. Nevertheless, the ANFIS model had a higher predictive capacity, with smaller MSE (0.36 for training and 0.29 for testing) compared to the ANN model © 2023 Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, Instituto de Ciencias de la Atmósfera y Cambio Climático.

In this study, we evaluate the performance of the second-generation China Meteorological Administration Land Data Assimilation System (CLDAS) and two simplified machine learning models to estimate ET0 when meteorological data are insufficient in China. The results show that, when a weather station lacks global solar radiation (Rs) data, the machine learning methods obtain better results in their estimation of ET0. However, when the meteorological station lacks relative humidity (RH) and 2 m wind speed (U2) data, using RHCLD and U2CLD from the CLDAS to estimate ET0 and to replace the meteorological station data obtains better results. When all the data from the meteorological station are missing, estimating ET0 using the CLDAS data still produces relevant results.

This study developed and assessed a novel machine learning (ML) method for estimating CTc and AGB using time-series unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based multispectral vegetation indices (VIs) of maize under several irrigation treatments at the field scale. Four ML regression methods: multiple linear regression (MLR), support vector regression (SVR), random forest regression (RFR), and adaptive boosting regression (ABR), were used to address the complex relationship between CTc and VIs. AGB was then estimated using exponential, logistic, sigmoid, and linear equations because of their clear mathematical formulations based on the optimal CTc estimation model. The UAV VIs-derived CTc using the RFR estimation model yielded the highest accuracy (R2 = 0.91, RMSE = 0.0526, and nRMSE = 9.07%). The normalized difference red-edge index, transformed chlorophyll absorption in reflectance index, and simple ratio contributed significantly to the RFR-based CTc model. The accuracy of AGB estimation using nonlinear methods was higher than that using the linear method. The exponential method yielded the highest accuracy (R2 = 0.76, RMSE = 282.8 g m−2, and nRMSE = 39.24%) in both the 2018 and 2019 growing seasons.

The accurate estimation of reference evapotranspiration (ET0) is of the utmost importance for computing crop water requirements, agricultural water management, and irrigation scheduling design. However, due to the combination of insufficient meteorological data and uncertain inputs, the accuracy and stability of the ET0 prediction model were different to varying degrees. Methods: Six machine learning models were proposed in the current study for daily ET0 estimation. Information on the weather, such as the maximum and minimum air temperatures, solar radiation, relative humidity, and wind speed, during the period 1960~2019 was obtained from eighteen stations in the northeast of Inner Mongolia, China. Three input combinations were utilized to train and test the proposed models and compared with the corresponding empirical equations, including two temperature-based, three radiation-based, and two humidity-based empirical equations. To evaluate the ET0 estimation models, two strategies were used: (1) in each weather station, we trained and tested the proposed machine learning model, and then compared it with the empirical equations, and (2) using the K-means algorithm, all weather stations were sorted into three groups based on their average climatic features. Then, each station tested the machine learning model trained using the other stations within the group. Three statistical indicators, namely, determination coefficient (R2), root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE), were used to evaluate the performance of the models. Results: The results showed the following: (1) The temperature-based temporal convolutional neural network (TCN) model outperformed the empirical equations in the first strategy, as shown by the TCN’s R2 values being 0.091, 0.050, and 0.061 higher than those of empirical equations; the RMSE of the TCN being significantly lower than that of empirical equations by 0.224, 0.135, and 0.159 mm/d; and the MAE of the TCN being significantly lower than that of empirical equations by 0.208, 0.151, and 0.097 mm/d, and compared with the temperature-based empirical equations, the TCN model markedly reduced RMSE and MAE while increasing R2 in the second strategy. (2) In comparison to the radiation-based empirical equations, all machine learning models reduced RMSE and MAE, while significantly increasing R2 in both strategies, particularly the TCN model. (3) In addition, in both strategies, all machine learning models, particularly the TCN model, enhanced R2 and reduced RMSE and MAE significantly when compared to humidity-based empirical equations. Conclusions: When the radiation or humidity characteristics were added to the given temperature characteristics, all the proposed machine learning models could estimate ET0, and its accuracy was higher than the calibrated empirical equations external to the training study area, which makes it possible to develop an ET0 estimation model for cross-station data with similar meteorological characteristics to obtain a satisfactory ET0 estimation for the target station. © 2022 by the authors.",modeling; reference evapotranspiration; temporal convolution neural network,Nei Monggol; Agriculture; Atmospheric temperature; Convolution; Evapotranspiration; K-means clustering; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Machine learning; Meteorology; Multilayer neural networks; Neural network models; Scheduling; Water management; Water supply; Weather information services; Wind; Convolution neural network; Convolutional neural network; Empirical equations; Machine learning models; Mean absolute error; Modeling; Neural network model; Reference evapotranspiration; Root mean square errors; Temporal convolution neural network; artificial neural network; data set; evapotranspiration; machine learning; modeling; Mean square error,Yes,Yes,weather station,climate & meteorology,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

In this study, five data intelligent and hybrid metaheuristic machine learning algorithms, namely additive regression (AR), AR-bagging, AR-random subspace (AR-RSS), AR-M5P, and AR-REPTree, were applied to predict monthly mean daily reference evapotranspiration (ET0). For this purpose, climatic data of two meteorological stations located in the semi-arid region of Pakistan were used from the period 1987 to 2016. The climatic dataset includes maximum and minimum temperature (Tmax, Tmin), average relative humidity (RHavg), average wind speed (Ux), and sunshine hours (n). Sensitivity analysis through regression methods was applied to determine effective input climatic parameters for ET0 modeling. The results of performed regression analysis on all input parameters proved that Tmin, RHAvg, Ux, and n were identified as the most influential input parameters at the studied station. From the results, it was revealed that all the selected models predicted ET0 at both stations with greater precision. The AR-REPTree model was located furthest and the AR-M5P model was located nearest to the observed point based on the performing indices at both the selected meteorological stations. The study concluded that under the aforementioned methodological framework, the AR-M5P model can yield higher accuracy in predicting ET0 values, as compared to other selected algorithms. © 2022, The Author(s).",Additive regression; Hydrological modeling; Machine learning; Reference evapotranspiration; Sensitivity and regression analysis,Pakistan; Additives; Developing countries; Evapotranspiration; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Meteorology; Regression analysis; Wind; Additive regression; Climatic data; Data intelligence; Hybrid metaheuristic algorithms; Hydrological models; Input parameter; Meteorological input; Meteorological station; Model development; Reference evapotranspiration; accuracy assessment; algorithm; developing world; estimation method; evapotranspiration; heuristics; hydrological modeling; machine learning; precision; regression analysis; relative humidity; resource scarcity; semiarid region; sensitivity analysis; water management; wind velocity; Sensitivity analysis,Yes,Yes,weather station,climate & meteorology,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

FAO56 Penman–Monteith (FAO56 P–M) reference evapotranspiration calculated with meteorological data (1981–2021) obtained from sixty-two meteorological stations nationwide is used as the label. All study datasets provide daily, monthly, or annual values based on the average temperature, daily temperature difference, and extraterrestrial radiation. Multiple linear regression (MLR) and polynomial regression (PR) are applied as machine learning algorithms, and twelve models are tested using the training data. The results of the performance evaluation of the period from 2017 to 2021 show that the polynomial regression algorithm that learns the amount of extraterrestrial radiation achieves the best performance (the minimum root-mean-square errors of 0.72 mm/day, 11.3 mm/month, and 40.5 mm/year for daily, monthly, and annual scale, respectively). Compared to temperature-based empirical equations, such as Hargreaves, Blaney–Criddle, and Thornthwaite, the model trained using the polynomial regression algorithm achieves the highest coefficient of determination and lowest error with the reference evapotranspiration of the FAO56 Penman–Monteith equation when using all meteorological data.

Three satellite-derived variables were selected, namely enhanced vegetation index (EVI), leaf area index (LAI) and land surface temperature (LST). The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) was used for regression, while random forest (RF), support vector regression (SVR) and long short-term memory (LSTM) methods were selected for machine learning. The three variables serve as inputs to these methods, and their efficacy in predicting corn yield was assessed in relation to evapotranspiration (ET). The results confirmed that a high level of performance can be achieved for yield prediction (mean predicted R2 = 0.63) by combining EVI + LAI + LST with the four methods. Among them, the best results were obtained by using LSTM (mean predicted R2 = 0.67). EVI and LST provided extra and unique information in peak and early growth stages for corn yield, respectively, and the usefulness of including LAI was not readily apparent across the whole season, which was consistent with the field growing conditions affecting the ET of corn.

(2011). Although studies have modelled the spatial variations in g1, disclosing its variations over environmental gradients and different plant functional types. However, the above methods are still not accurate enough on a global scale, as they do not consider the temporal variations in g1. To address this issue we used the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) to assimilate tower-based gross primary productivity (GPP) and latent heat flux (LE) of 17 cropland flux sites into a remote sensing (RS)-based evapotranspiration-photosynthesis coupled model, termed SCOPES-Crop, to derive the temporal variations in g1 for C3 and C4 crops. We also used the feedforward artificial neural network (FANN) along with RS variables to model g1. Results showed g1 to rise rapidly in spring and summer, and then decline in autumn. The value of g1 reached the lowest value and remained stable in wintertime. FANN-based modeling of g1 showed R(RMSE) = 0.81 (1.94 kPa0.5) and 0.90 (0.70 kPa0.5) for C3 and C4 Crops, respectively, for the testing dataset. The estimates of GPP and LE using FANN-derived g1 at the 17 flux sites were improved as compared to that using fixed g1. The mean values of site-level R(RMSE) for GPP and LE simulated using FANN-derived g1 are 0.92 (1.8 gC m−2 d-2) and 0.85 (22.5 W m−2), respectively. Our results revealed notable seasonal variations in g1, indicating the importance of considering the temporal variations in g1 in evapotranspiration-photosynthesis coupled model.

This study leverages this valuable information with model-data integration and deep learning to estimate canopy conductance in a hybrid catchment-scale model for more accurate hydrological simulations. Using data from three consecutive growing seasons, we first highlight that integrating canopy conductance inferred from sap flow data in a hydrological model leads to more realistic soil moisture estimates than using the conventional Jarvis-Stewart equation, particularly during drought conditions. The applicability of this first approach is, however, limited to the period where sap flow data are available. To overcome this limitation, we subsequently train a recurrent neural network (RNN) to predict catchment-averaged sap velocities based on standard hourly meteorological data. These simulated velocities are then used to estimate canopy conductance, allowing simulations for periods without sap flow data. We show that the hybrid model, which uses the canopy conductance from the machine learning (ML) approach, matches soil moisture and transpiration equally as well as model runs using observed sap flow data and has good potential for extrapolation beyond the study site. We conclude that such hybrid approaches open promising avenues for parametrizations of complex water-plant dynamics by improving our ability to incorporate novel or untypical data sets into hydrological models.  © Author(s) 2022.",,Catchments; Data integration; Learning systems; Plant shutdowns; Plants (botany); Recurrent neural networks; Runoff; Transpiration; Water supply; Atmospheric water; Canopy conductance; Catchment scale; Flow data; Hybrid model; Hydrological models; Sap flow; Soil water; Supply waters; Water demand; artificial neural network; canopy architecture; growing season; hydrological modeling; parameterization; sap flow; simulation; soil moisture; Soil moisture,Yes,Yes,"weather station, sap flow","soil, plant physiology",0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1

Timely and accurate assessment of pressure from competition is crucial for ecological weed management. In this work, we apply hyperspectral remote sensing (HRS) technology to conduct a competitive experiment in Harbin, China, in 2021, with 5-leaf maize as the study target. A weed competition assessment method that combines comprehensive competition indices (CCI) and deep learning is proposed. For the comprehensive competition assessment, the relationship between different weed competitive pressures (Levels 1–5) and changes in the structural and physiological information of maize was analyzed. The accumulative/transient competition indices CCI-A and CCI-T were designed for accurate quantification. The results showed that parameters such as plant height, stalk thickness and nutrient elements of maize decreased with increasing competition level. Parameters, such as stomatal conductance and transpiration rate, showed a fluctuating change of increasing and then decreasing with increasing competition level. Compared with the traditional relative competitive intensity (RCI), the standard deviation of CCI is 0.303 and 0.499. The dispersion effect of CCI is better and more suitable for quantifying the competition response. HRS images combined with 3D-CNN model were then applied to reveal the spectral response to different weed competition pressures (Levels 1–5) and to make early predictions of weed competition. The first-order derivative showed that the spectral reflectance exhibited significant differences at 520–525 nm peak, 570–655 nm trough, and near 700 nm red edge. For hyperspectral spatial-spectral features, the 3D-CNN model is proposed for prediction of competing indices CCI. In addition, the VIP method is used to select the characteristic wavelengths. The 3D-CNN model achieves a prediction accuracy of RMSE = 0.106 and 0.152 using 13 feature bands, which can accurately quantify the subtle changes in competition indices. Overall, this study shows that the combination of CCI and deep learning can provide a multivariate and comprehensive assessment of weed competition pressure. © 2022",Competition indices; Deep learning; Hyperspectral remote sensing; Weed competition,Ecosystem; Farms; Hyperspectral Imaging; Plant Leaves; Zea mays; China; Harbin; Heilongjiang; 3D modeling; Ecology; Forecasting; Losses; Remote sensing; CNN models; Competition index; Competition levels; Deep learning; Economic loss; Farmland ecosystem; Hyperspectral remote sensing; Level-1; Pressure level; Weed competition; artificial neural network; competition (ecology); machine learning; maize; prediction; remote sensing; spectral reflectance; three-dimensional modeling; weed; agricultural land; article; China; competition; deep learning; ecosystem; maize; nonhuman; nutrient; plant height; plant leaf; prediction; quantitative analysis; remote sensing; stomatal conductance; sweating; thickness; agricultural land; chemistry; Deep learning,Yes,Yes,remote sensing,"vegetation indices, plant physiology",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1

Multiple years of eddy covariance (EC) tower ET measurements at five representative wetland ecosystems in the subtropical Big Cypress National Preserve (BCNP), Florida (USA) provide a unique opportunity to assess the performance of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) ET operational product MOD16A2 and upscale tower measured ET to generate local/regional wetland ET maps. We developed an object-based machine learning ensemble approach to evaluate and map wetland ET by linking tower measured ET with key predictors from MODIS products and meteorological variables. The results showed MOD16A2 had poor performance in characterizing ET patterns and was unsatisfactory for estimating ET over four wetland communities where Nash-Sutcliffe model Efficiency (NSE) was less than 0.5. In contrast, the site-specific machine learning ensemble model had a high predictive power with a NSE larger than 0.75 across all EC sites. We mapped the ET rate for two distinctive seasons and quantified the prediction diversity to identify regions easier or more challenging to estimate from model-based analyses.

In the present study, an efficient deep learning model, Auto Encode Decoder Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (AED-BiLSTM), was applied for the first time in forecasting 1–3 weeks ahead of weekly ETo. Three meteorological stations, including Kermanshah (semi-arid), Nowshahr (very humid), and Yazd (arid), which have different climates, were investigated and evaluated. For this purpose, a statistical period of 20 years (2000 to 2019), of which 15 years (2000–2014) for training and the final five years (2015–2015) for model testing were considered. The generalized regression neural network (GRNN) and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) machine learning models were used to compare the performance of the newly developed model. A novel CatBoost-Boruta algorithm was used to determine the critical lags in the forecasting process. The results showed that the newly developed model (AED-BiLSTM) in all three meteorological stations had higher ability and accuracy in forecasting weekly ETo than the GRNN and XGBoost models. The outcomes of testing phase in Kermanshah station ascertained that the AED-BiLSTM in terms of (ETo(t + 1): R (correlation coefficient) = 0.9835, RMSE (root mean square error, mm/week) = 3.4597; ETo(t + 2): R = 0.9805, RMSE = 3.7215; ETo(t + 3): R = 0.9795, RMSE = 3.8857) outperformed the other models. In Nowshahr station AED-BiLSTM model had higher accuracy in terms of (ETo(t + 1): R = 0.9057, RMSE = 4.6786; ETo(t + 2): R = 0.9036, RMSE = 4.7697; ETo(t + 3): R = 0.9024, RMSE = 4.8437). Also, in Yazd station AED-BiLSTM perform better than other models in terms of (ETo(t + 1): R = 0.9827, RMSE = 3.1319; ETo(t + 2): R = 0.9800, RMSE = 3.3998; ETo(t + 3): R = 0.9774, RMSE = 3.5679). The XGBoost and GRNN models performed better after the AED-BiLSTM model, respectively. The effect of climate type on the accuracy of the models showed that the models have higher efficiency and accuracy in arid and semi-arid climates. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Auto Decoder Encoder; Bi-LSTM; Boruta-Catboost; FAO-56 Penman-Monteith; Forecasting; Reference evapotranspiration,Iran; Kermanshah; Adaptive boosting; Decoding; Evapotranspiration; Mean square error; Meteorology; Signal encoding; Water supply; Weather forecasting; Auto decoder encoder; Bi-LSTM; Borutum-catboost; FAO-56 penman-monteith; Generalized regression; Meteorological station; Penman Monteith; Reference evapotranspiration; Regression neural networks; Root mean square errors; accuracy assessment; evapotranspiration; forecasting method; machine learning; model; Long short-term memory,Yes,Yes,weather station,"climate & meteorology, vegetation indices",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0

One example of this technology is using IoT soil moisture sensors for scheduling irrigation. Soil moisture sensors are usually deployed in nodes. A more significant number of sensors/nodes is recommended in larger fields, such as those found in broadacre agriculture, to better account for soil heterogeneity. However, this comes at a higher and often limiting cost for farmers (purchase, labour costs from installation and removal, and maintenance). Methodologies that enable maintaining the monitoring capability/intensity with a reduced number of in-field sensors would be valuable for the sector and of great interest. In this study, sensor data analysis conducted across two irrigation seasons in three cotton fields from two cotton-growing areas of Australia, identified a relationship between soil matric potential and cumulative satellite-derived crop evapotranspiration (ETcn) between irrigation events. A second-degree function represents this relationship, which is affected by the crop development stage, rainfall, irrigation events and the transition between saturated and non-saturated soil. Two machine learning models [a Dense Multilayer Perceptron (DMP) and Support Vector Regression (SVR) algorithms] were studied to explore these second-degree function properties and assess whether the models were capable of learning the pattern of the soil matric potential-ETcn relation to estimate soil moisture from satellite-derived ETc measurements. The algorithms performance evaluation in predicting soil matric potential applied the k-fold method in each farm individually and combining data from all fields and seasons. The latter approach made it possible to avoid the influence of farm consultants’ decisions regarding when to irrigate the crop in the training process. Both algorithms accurately estimated soil matric potential for individual (up to 90% of predicted values within ±10 kPa) and combined datasets (73% of predicted values within ±10 kPa). The technique presented here can accurately monitor soil matric potential in the root zone of cotton plants with reduced in-field sensor equipment and offers promising applications for its use in irrigation-decision systems.

In this regard, the application of the standard model, FAO-56 Penman–Monteith, is limited because of insufficient meteorological data. This study aims to improve the accuracy of ETo calculations in regions with scarce meteorological data. A hybrid model integrating two data preprocessing methods (variational mode decomposition (VMD) and Box–Cox transformation (BC)) into a support vector machine (SVM) model (VMD–BC–SVM) is proposed. The model estimates the daily ETo based on the meteorological data (1980–2019) of 10 stations in the Wei River Basin of China. The VMD method was employed to extract multiple intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) and eliminate non-stationarity. This is achieved by decomposing meteorological factors, which are further transformed by BC to alleviate skewness characteristics. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression (LASSO) identifies the key driving modes from the transformed IMFs, which are used as the input of the SVM model. The VMD–BC–SVM estimation model framework based on decomposition–transformation–identification–estimation is proposed. The performance of each of the hybrid VMD–BC–SVM models was further compared with those of the standalone extreme learning machine (ELM) model and two empirical models (Hargreaves–Samani and Priestley–Taylor models). The results revealed that the hybrid models outperformed the single models. The VMD–BC–SVM model achieved higher accuracy compared with the other models. Specifically, the coefficient of correlation (R) and Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NSE) were both greater than 0.96. Furthermore, the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and root mean square error (RMSE) were less than 8.41% and 0.38 mm/d, respectively. In terms of the amount of information provided, the VMD–BC–SVM model is superior to empirical models in identifying high-dimensional and nonlinear information. Moreover, the estimation performance is more stable, and the level of uncertainty is lower. This study provides a novel approach for predicting ETo in regions with limited meteorological data. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Box–Cox transformation; Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator; Support vector machine; Variational mode decomposition; Wei River Basin,China; Wei Basin; Evapotranspiration; Mean square error; Metadata; Shrinkage; Support vector machines; Watersheds; Box Cox transformation; Hybrid model; Least absolute shrinkage and selection operators; Meteorological data; Reference evapotranspiration; River basins; Support vector machine models; Support vectors machine; Wei river; Wei river basin; decomposition analysis; estimation method; evapotranspiration; identification key; machine learning; Penman-Monteith equation; support vector machine; transformation; water planning; water resource; Variational mode decomposition,Yes,Yes,"weather station, empirical models","climate & meteorology, vegetation indices",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0

This study compared the transpiration estimation performance of multiple linear regression (MLR), modified Jarvis–Stewart (MJS), and Shuttleworth–Wallace (S-W) with deep belief network (DBN), long short-term memory recurrent neural network (LSTM-RNN), and LSTM-RNN improved with multiple restricted Boltzmann machines (R-L-RNN) using 31 input combinations comprising complete subsets of Vapor pressure deficit (VPD), Net solar radiation (Rn), Average air temperature (Ta), Soil water content (SWC), and Leaf area index (LAI) observations collected at Wuwei, Changwu and Taigu stations on the Loess Plateau in China. The results showed that R-L-RNN obtained the most accurate estimations in the partial canopy stage, dense canopy stage, and whole growth stage, compared to MLR, MJS, S-W, DBN, and LSTM-RNN. The accuracy of the deep learning models (DNN) increased exponentially as the number of input variables increased, and the importance of the input variables followed the orders of: LAI > VPD > Rn > Ta > SWC in the partial and whole canopy stage, and VPD > Rn > Ta > LAI > SWC in the dense canopy stage. The apple tree transpiration models were more accurate in the partial and dense canopy stages than the whole growth stage. The coefficient of determination and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient for the R-L-RNN model increased by 8.1–13.1% and 11.2–25.4% in the partial canopy stage, respectively, and by 2.6–6.9% and 14.7–20.1% in the dense canopy stage, whereas the relative root mean square error decreased by 8.7–28.6% and 17.3–38.2%. Overall, R-L-RNN is the most recommended model for estimating the apple tree transpiration, because it is such a simple method that agricultural water managers can easily determine the water consumption of apple trees using limited accessible observational data. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Empirical model; Growth stage; Hybrid deep learning model; Input variable; Path analysis,Changwu; China; Gansu; Loess Plateau; Shaanxi; Shanxi; Taigu; Wuwei; Forestry; Fruits; Landforms; Learning systems; Long short-term memory; Mean square error; Multiple linear regression; Plants (botany); Sediments; Transpiration; Trees (mathematics); Apple trees; Dense canopy; Empirical model; Growth stages; Hybrid deep learning model; Input variables; Learning models; Path analysis; Soil water content; Vapor pressure deficit; air temperature; canopy architecture; deciduous tree; estimation method; growth; leaf area index; machine learning; numerical model; path analysis; transpiration; water content; Soil moisture,Yes,Yes,Not Specified,"climate & meteorology, vegetation indices",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0

The objective of this study is to predict the regional sugarcane crop yield for the Uttar Pradesh (UP) province using analysis-ready moderate-resolution satellite images. The four machine learning regression algorithms, namely support vector regression (SVR), gradient boosting regression (GBR), eXtreme gradient boosting regression (XGB), and random forest regression (RF), were used to train and predict the district-wise sugarcane yield in UP. Standard MODIS data products such as leaf area index (LAI), fraction of photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), evapotranspiration (ET), potential evapotranspiration (PET), latent heat flux (LE), and gross primary product (GPP) were obtained for a period of eighteen years, and their monthly average was extracted and used as features in the model. The models were trained using eighty percent of the observations with the annual district-wise sugarcane yield as the response variable. Iterative feature selection was done based on correlation factor and feature importance to reduce the dimensionality of the data from around a hundred features to twenty-four. The R2 metric was used as the evaluation metric to choose the best predictive model. The study showed results with moderate accuracy and was used to estimate the sugarcane crop yield for the year 2019. The highest R2 of 0.66 and an RMSE value of 7.15 t/ha were obtained using the GBR algorithm by using seven variables and 24 features. The model was very closely followed by the XGB model with an R2 of 0.65 and an RMSE value of 7.20 t/ha. The FPAR-based features contributed the most to the model followed by the LAI and NDVI features. The simple methodology used in the study uses ready-to-use satellite products and has operationalization potential. The model can be improved by incorporating more satellite-derived parameters and an accurate crop mask to avoid spectral interference from other cropland. © 2022, Indian Society of Remote Sensing.",FPAR; Gradient boosting; MODIS; Random forest; Regional; Sugarcane; XGBoost; Yield prediction,India; Uttar Pradesh; crop; evapotranspiration; latent heat flux; machine learning; photosynthetically active radiation; vegetation index,Yes,Yes,remote sensing,"climate & meteorology, vegetation indices",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0
948,Ge J.; Zhao L.; Yu Z.; Liu H.; Zhang L.; Gong X.; Sun H.,Prediction of Greenhouse Tomato Crop Evapotranspiration Using XGBoost Machine Learning Model,2022,10.3390/plants11151923,"Crop evapotranspiration estimation is a key parameter for achieving functional irrigation systems. However, ET is difficult to directly measure, so an ideal solution was to develop a simulation model to obtain ET. There are many ways to calculate ET, most of which use models based on the Penman–Monteith equation, but they are often inaccurate when applied to greenhouse crop evapotranspiration. The use of machine learning models to predict ET has gradually increased, but research into their application for greenhouse crops is relatively rare. We used experimental data for three years (2019–2021) to model the effects on ET of eight meteorological factors (net solar radiation (Rn), mean temperature (Ta), minimum temperature (Tamin), maximum temperature (Tamax), relative humidity (RH), minimum relative humidity (RHmin), maximum relative humidity (RHmax), and wind speed (V)) using a greenhouse drip irrigated tomato crop ET prediction model (XGBR-ET) that was based on XGBoost regression (XGBR). The model was compared with seven other common regression models (linear regression (LR), support vector regression (SVR), K neighbors regression (KNR), random forest regression (RFR), AdaBoost regression (ABR), bagging regression (BR), and gradient boosting regression (GBR)). The results showed that Rn, Ta, and Tamax were positively correlated with ET, and that Tamin, RH, RHmin, RHmax, and V were negatively correlated with ET. Rn had the greatest correlation with ET (r = 0.89), and V had the least correlation with ET (r = 0.43). The eight models were ordered, in terms of prediction accuracy, XGBR-ET > GBR-ET > SVR-ET > ABR-ET > BR-ET > LR-ET > KNR-ET > RFR-ET. The statistical indicators mean square error (0.032), root mean square error (0.163), mean absolute error (0.132), mean absolute percentage error (4.47%), and coefficient of determination (0.981) of XGBR-ET showed that XGBR-ET modeled daily ET for greenhouse tomatoes well. The parameters of the XGBR-ET model were ablated to show that the order of importance of meteorological factors on XGBR-ET was Rn > RH > RHmin> Tamax> RHmax> Tamin> Ta> V. Selecting Rn, RH, RHmin, Tamax, and Tamin as model input variables using XGBR ensured the prediction accuracy of the model (mean square error 0.047).

In this regard, it is inevitable to estimate the b-factor provided by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations Irrigation and Drainage Paper number 24. In this study, five soft computing methods, namely random forest (RF), M5 model tree (M5), support vector regression with the polynomial function (SVR-poly), support vector regression with radial basis function kernel (SVR-rbf), and random tree (RT), were adapted to estimate the b-factor. And Their performances were also compared. The suitable hyper-parameters for each soft computing method were investigated. Five statistical indices were deployed to evaluate their performance, i.e., the coefficient of determination (r2), the mean absolute relative error (MARE), the maximum absolute relative error (MXARE), the standard deviation of the absolute relative error (DEV), and the number of samples with an error greater than 2% (NE > 2%). Findings reveal that SVR-rbf gave the highest performance among five soft computing models, followed by the M5, RF, SVR-poly, and RT. The M5 also derived a new explicit equation for b estimation. SVR-rbf provided a bit lower efficacy than the radial basis function network but outperformed the regression equations.

To improve the accuracy of predicting ETO in different climate zones in China that lack meteorological data, an ETO hybrid model based on K-nearest neighbour (KNN) machine learning algorithm for extracting factor contribution rates is proposed in this study. Meteorological factors with large contribution rates were selected as input, and a prediction model for ETO was established using the Elman daily ETO prediction model. The ETO prediction model was optimised using three optimisation algorithms [Genetic optimization algorithm (GA), Cuckoo optimization algorithm (CS) and Whale optimization algorithm (WOA)] to improve the accuracy of ETO prediction. The results revealed that surface radiation (Rs) is the most important factor in estimating ETO (contribution rate = 0.392–0.626), followed by temperature factors (T; including maximum, minimum, and average temperatures). And each model has the highest accuracy with the input combination of Rs and T. For the different machine learning models, the CS-Elman model had the highest accuracy (RMSE = 0.468–2.235, R2 = 0.567–0.928, MAE = 0.363–1.343, and NSE = 0.345–0.923), and the machine learning model had higher accuracy than the experience model. The CS-Elman model performed more favourably in tropical monsoon and subtropical monsoon regions than that in other areas, and the model performed best at the junction of two climatic zones.

In this study, we designed FarmCan, a novel, robust remote sensing and machine learning (ML) framework to forecast farms' needed daily crop water quantity or needed irrigation (NI). We used a diverse set of simulated and observed near-real-time (NRT) remote sensing data coupled with a random forest (RF) algorithm and inputs about farm-specific situations to predict the amount and timing of evapotranspiration (ET), potential ET (PET), soil moisture (SM), and root zone soil moisture (RZSM). Our case study of four farms in the Canadian Prairies Ecozone (CPE) shows that 8 d composite precipitation (P) has the highest correlation with changes (Δ) of RZSM and SM. In contrast, 8 d PET and 8 d ET do not offer a strong correlation with 8 d P. Using R2, root mean square error (RMSE), and Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE) indicators, our algorithm could reasonably calculate daily NI up to 14 d in advance. From 2015 to 2020, the R2 values between predicted and observed 8 d ET and 8 d PET were the highest (80 % and 54 %, respectively). The 8 d NI also had an average R2 of 68%. The KGE of the 8 d ET and 8 d PET in four study farms showed an average of 0.71 and 0.50, respectively, with an average KGE of 0.62. FarmCan can be used in any region of the world to help stakeholders make decisions during prolonged periods of drought or waterlogged conditions, schedule cropping and fertilization, and address local government policy concerns.

Heatwaves and drought, which are among the top stressors, commonly co-occur, and their frequency is increasing with global climate change. High-throughput methods were optimized to phenotype wheat plants under controlled water deficit and high temperature, with the aim to identify phenotypic traits conferring adaptative stress responses. Wheat plants of 10 genotypes were grown in a fully automated plant facility under 25/18 °C day/night for 30 d, and then the temperature was increased for 7 d (38/31 °C day/night) while maintaining half of the plants well irrigated and half at 30% field capacity. Thermal and multispectral images and pot weights were registered twice daily. At the end of the experiment, key metabolites and enzyme activities from carbohydrate and antioxidant metabolism were quantified. Regression machine learning models were successfully established to predict plant biomass using image-extracted parameters. Evapotranspiration traits expressed significant genotype-environment interactions (G×E) when acclimatization to stress was continuously monitored. Consequently, transpiration efficiency was essential to maintain the balance between water-saving strategies and biomass production in wheat under water deficit and high temperature. Stress tolerance included changes in carbohydrate metabolism, particularly in the sucrolytic and glycolytic pathways, and in antioxidant metabolism. The observed genetic differences in sensitivity to high temperature and water deficit can be exploited in breeding programmes to improve wheat resilience to climate change.  © The Author(s) 2022.

In the present study, the ability and precision of three artificial intelligence (AI) models (i.e., Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) and Categorical Boosting (CatBoost)) were assessed for estimating daily reference evapotranspiration (ET0) using limited weather data from five locations in a warm sub-humid climate in Mexico. The Penman–Monteith FAO-56 equation was used as a reference target for ET0 values. Three different input combinations were investigated, namely: temperature-based (minimum and maximum air temperature), rainfall-based (minimum air tem-perature, maximum air temperature and rainfall), and relative humidity-based (mini-mum air temperature, maximum air temperature and relative humidity). Extraterres-trial radiation values were used in all combinations. The temperature-based AI models were compared with the conventional Hargreaves–Samani (HS) model commonly used to estimate ET0 when only temperature records are available. The goodness of fit for all models was assessed in terms of the coefficient of determination (R2), Nash–Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient (NSE), root mean square error (RMSE) and mean abso-lute error (MAE). The results showed that among the AI models evaluated, the SVM models outperformed ANFIS and CatBoost for modeling ET0. Further, the influence of relative humidity and rainfall on the performance of the models was investigated. The analysis indicated that relative humidity significantly improved the accuracy of the models. Finally, the results showed a better response of the temperature-based AI models over the HS method.

Previous studies examining the underlying patterns of the complex relationship between canopy height and its environmental and climatic determinants suffered from the scarcity of accurate canopy height measurements at large scales. NASA’s mission, the Global Ecosystem Dynamic Investigation (GEDI), has provided sampled observations of the forest vertical structure at near global scale since late 2018. The availability of such unprecedented measurements allows for examining the vertical structure of vegetation spatially and temporally. Herein, we explore the most influential climatic and environmental drivers of the canopy height in tropical forests. We examined different resampling resolutions of GEDI-based canopy height to approximate maximum canopy height over tropical forests across all of Malaysia. Moreover, we attempted to interpret the dynamics underlining the bivariate and multivariate relationships between canopy height and its climatic and topographic predictors including world climate data and topographic data. The approaches to analyzing these interactions included machine learning algorithms, namely, generalized linear regression, random forest and extreme gradient boosting with tree and Dart implementations. Water availability, represented as the difference between precipitation and potential evapotranspiration, annual mean temperature and elevation gradients were found to be the most influential determinants of canopy height in Malaysia’s tropical forest landscape. The patterns observed are in line with the reported global patterns and support the hydraulic limitation hypothesis and the previously reported negative trend for excessive water supply. Nevertheless, different breaking points for excessive water supply and elevation were identified in this study, and the canopy height relationship with water availability observed to be less significant for the mountainous forest on altitudes higher than 1000 m. This study provides insights into the influential factors of tree height and helps with better comprehending the variation in canopy height in tropical forests based on GEDI measurements, thereby supporting the development and interpretation of ecosystem modeling, forest management practices and monitoring forest response to climatic changes in montane forests. © 2022 by the authors.

Black walnut (Juglans nigra) is one of the most valuable timber species in North America. However, little is known about how the stocking of black walnut would change with differed bioclimatic conditions under climate change. In this study, we projected the current and future basal area of black walnut. We trained different machine learning models using more than 1.4 million tree records from 10,162 Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) sample plots and 42 spatially explicit bioclimate and other environmental attributes. We selected random forests (RF) as the final model to estimate the basal area of black walnut under climate change because RF had a higher coefficient of determination (R2), lower root mean square error (RMSE), and lower mean absolute error (MAE) than the other two models (XGBoost and linear regression). The most important variables to predict basal area were the mean annual temperature and precipitation, potential evapotranspiration, topology, and human footprint. Under two emission scenarios (Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5 and 8.5), the RF model projected that black walnut stocking would increase in the northern part of the current range in the USA by 2080, with a potential shift of species distribution range although uncertainty still exists due to unpredictable events, including extreme abiotic (heat, drought) and biotic (pests, disease) occurrences. Our models can be adapted to other hardwood tree species to predict tree changes in basal area based on future climate scenarios.

Accurate regional AET estimation is a prerequisite for investigating its spatio-temporal characteristics and is critical to climate change assessment and hydrological cycle. Eddy covariance (EC) measurements are usually regarded as the ground truth to verify the reliability of other AET estimation models. However, EC flux towers are usually distributed sparsely and cannot fully reflect the actual spatial features of AET. This study proposes a hybrid machine learning model, called the hybrid Convolutional Neural Network and Random Forests (CNN-RF) model, and applies it to the regional AET estimation over the Tuojiang River Basin. The results demonstrate the excellent performance of the CNN-RF model at the site level and the superiority of the CNN-RF model over hybrid Convolutional Neural Network and Support Vector Machine (CNN-SVM), CNN, SVM, and RF models. The AET modeled by the CNN-RF model shows the highest correlation (correlation coefficient: 0.97) with the target value. Moreover, the mean absolute error (MAE) and the root mean square error (RMSE) for the CNN-RF-based modeling are the lowest, only 4.02 mm and 6.29 mm, respectively. Additionally, the CNN-RF-estimated AET shows good agreement with the AET simulated by the SWAT over the Tuojiang River Basin, further illustrating that the CNN-RF model based on remotely sensed variables has a strong generalization ability in space. The AET shows a high correlation with the air temperature and the precipitation; the correlation coefficients are 0.925 and 0.79, respectively. The evolution characteristics of these two meteorological variables govern the overall rise in annual AET during 1981–2020 (1.59 mm/year) over Tuojiang River Basin. This result may yield some insights into the interaction between various meteorological factors in the context of global warming and provide evidence for the impact of climate change on water and energy cycles. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Actual evapotranspiration; Convolutional Neural Network; Hydrological cycle; Random forests; Remotely sensed variables; SWAT,Climate models; Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Decision trees; Evapotranspiration; Global warming; Mean square error; Random forests; Rivers; Support vector machines; Watersheds; Actual evapotranspiration; Convolutional neural network; Correlation coefficient; Hydrological cycles; Random forest modeling; Random forests; Remotely sensed variable; River basins; SWAT; Water cycle; air temperature; algorithm; artificial neural network; climate change; evapotranspiration; global warming; hydrological cycle; machine learning; remote sensing; soil and water assessment tool; Remote sensing,Yes,Yes,"eddy covariance, weather station","climate & meteorology, vegetation indices",1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0

Therefore, this research proposed the application of machine learning algorithms to estimate the ETrF (Evapotranspiration Fraction) of sugar can crop using the METRIC (Mapping Evapotranspiration at High Resolution with Internalized Calibration) model with data from the Sentinel-2 satellites constellation. In order to achieve this goal, images from the MSI sensor (MultiSpectral Instrument) from the Sentinel-2 and the OLI (Operational Land Imager) and TIRS (Thermal Infrared Sensor) sensors from the Landsat-8 were acquired nearly at the same time between the years 2018 and 2020 for sugar cane crops. Images from OLI and TIR sensors were intended to calculate ETrF through METRIC (target variable), while for the MSI sensor images, the explanatory variables were extracted in two approaches, using 10 m (approach 1) and 20 m (approach 2) spatial resolution. The results showed that the algorithms were able to identify patterns in the MSI sensor data to predict the ETrF of the METRIC model. For approach 1, the best predictions were XgbLinear (R2 = 0.80; RMSE = 0.15) and XgbTree (R2 = 0.80; RMSE = 0.15). For approach 2, the algorithm that demonstrated superiority was the XgbLinear (R2 = 0.91; RMSE = 0.10), respectively. Thus, it became evident that machine learning algorithms, when applied to the MSI sensor, were able to estimate the ETrF in a simpler way than the one that involves energy balance with the thermal band used in the METRIC model. © 2022 by the authors.",irrigation scheduling; remote sensing; sugarcane,Crops; Infrared detectors; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Remote sensing; Sugar cane; Artificial intelligence algorithms; Computational applications; Computational resources; Irrigation scheduling; Machine learning algorithms; METRIC model; Modeling actual evapotranspiration; Operational land imager; Remote-sensing; Sugarcane; algorithm; evapotranspiration; irrigation; Landsat; machine learning; multispectral image; Sentinel; spatial resolution; sugar cane; Evapotranspiration,Yes,Yes,remote sensing,"climate & meteorology, vegetation indices",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0

A variety of methods are available for ETo simulation, but the most trending is complementary artificial intelligence (AI) paradigms. In this research, a novel Multivariate Variational Mode Decomposition technique (MVMD) integrated with the Ridge Regression (RR) feature selection algorithm and Kernel Extreme Learning Machine (KELM) model (i.e., MVMD-RR-KELM) was adopted to multi-step ahead (t + 3, and t + 7) forecasting of daily ETo in different climate of India. Here, the complementary expert system hybridized with the Boosted Regression Tree (BRT) and Extreme Gradient Boosted (XGBoost) along with the standalone counterpart models (KELM, BRT, and XGBoost) were examined to validate the robustness of the primary model. The complementary (i.e., MVMD-RR-KELM, MVMD-RR-BRT, & MVMD-RR-XGBoost) and their standalone counterpart models were trained and tested using daily climatic data of Hisar (located in Haryana State), Bathinda, and Ludhiana (located in Punjab State) sites. The forecasting accuracy of standalone and hybrid AI models was assessed using six goodness-of-fit metrics, i.e., R (Correlation Coefficient), RMSE (root mean square error), MAPE (mean absolute percentage error), NSE (Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency), IA (Index of Agreement), U95% (Uncertainty Coefficient with 95% level) along with visual interpretation. According to the testing results, the hybrid MVMD-RR-KELM models had superior performance than other AI models for forecasting three and seven days ahead ETo. The KELM model optimized using the MVMD-RR technique provides promising and robust results with higher forecasting accuracy and minimum error for multi-step ahead forecasting of ETo in semi-arid and sub-humid regions. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Haryana; Integrative artificial intelligence; Multi-step ahead forecasting; MVMD; Reference evapotranspiration,India; Climate models; Errors; Evapotranspiration; Expert systems; Feature extraction; Forecasting; Learning systems; Mean square error; Regression analysis; Scheduling; Water management; Haryanum; Integrative artificial intelligence; Learning machines; Machine modelling; Mode decomposition techniques; Multi-step ahead forecasting; Multisteps; Multivariate variational mode decomposition technique; Reference evapotranspiration; Ridge regression; artificial intelligence; climate change; evapotranspiration; expert system; forecasting method; multiple regression; Variational mode decomposition,Yes,Yes,Not Specified,"climate & meteorology, vegetation indices",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0
1001,Hobeichi S.; Abramowitz G.; Evans J.P.; Ukkola A.,"Toward a Robust, Impact-Based, Predictive Drought Metric",2022,10.1029/2021WR031829,"This work presents a new approach to defining drought by establishing an empirical relationship between historical droughts (and wet spells) documented in impact reports, and a broad range of observed climate features using Random Forest (RF) models. The new drought indicator quantifies the conditional probability of drought, considering multiple drought-related climate features and their interactive effects, and can be used for forecasting with up to 3-month lead time. The approach was tested out-of-sample across several random selections of training and testing datasets, and demonstrated better predictive capabilities than commonly used drought indicators (e.g., Standardised Precipitation Index and Evaporative Demand Drought Index) in a range of performance metrics. Furthermore, it showed comparable performance to the (expert elicitation-based) US Drought Monitor (USDM), the current state-of-the-art record of historical drought in the USA. As well as providing an alternative historical drought indicator to USDM, the RF approach offers additional advantages by being automated, by providing drought information at the grid-scale, and by having forecasting capacity. While traditional drought metrics define drought as extreme anomalies in drought-related variables, the approach presented here reveals the full suite of circumstances that lead to impactful droughts. We highlight several combinations of climate features—such as precipitation, potential evapotranspiration, soil moisture and change in water storage—that led to drought events not detected by commonly used drought metrics. The new RF drought indicator combines meteorological, hydrological, agricultural, and socioeconomic drought, providing drought information for all impacted sectors. As a proof-of-concept, the RF drought indicator was trained on Texan climate data and droughts. © 2022.

The key physical quantity of the water cycle can also pose a great challenge to the water balance for the decision-making on the agricultural water use plan at present. The ET0 in the facilities can be generally estimated by the improved empirical formula with high accuracy. But, much more meteorological parameters are required during estimation. It is prohibitively expensive for the experimental cost of ET0 estimation using measurement instruments for the meteorological parameters in the shading facilities. Alternatively, machine learning can be expected to easily obtain the meteorological parameters outside the facilities. However, only a few studies were focused on the estimation of ET0 in this case. In this study, an efficient and accurate estimation of the ET0 was proposed to clarify the relationship between the meteorological parameters inside and outside of Panax notoginseng shading facility. A Sobol sensitivity analysis was implemented to determine the effective meteorological parameters outside the facility as the model input. A Penman-Monteith model was used to calculate the standard values. Three ET0 estimation models (BO-SVR, BO-RF, and BO-ELM) were established, where the Bayesian Optimization (BO) was used to optimize the parameters in the Support Vector Regression (SVR), Random Forest (RF), and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM). The results showed that there was a strong correlation between six meteorological parameters inside and outside the shading facility, among which the average temperature, the maximum temperature, the minimum temperature, and average relative humidity were significantly correlated, and the coefficient of determination (R2) values were 0.914, 0.721, 0.925 and 0.923, respectively. The radiation term was close to 0 in the shading facility. The ET0 was approximately equal to the aerodynamic term, where the R2, the Root-Mean-Square Error (RMSE), and the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) were 0.999, 0.008 mm/d, and 0.006 mm/d, respectively. There was a strong correlation between the aerodynamic terms inside and outside the shading facility, where the R2, RMSE, and MAE were 0.856, 0.097 mm/d, and 0.073 mm/d, respectively. Therefore, it was feasible to estimate the ET0 in the shading facility of Panax notoginseng using the meteorological factors outside the facility. In Sobol sensitivity analysis, the ET0 in the shading facility was highly sensitive to the average relative humidity, average wind speed, maximum temperature, and average temperature, with the first-order sensitivity coefficients of 0.450, 0.304, 0.064, and 0.026, respectively. There was a small influence of the minimum temperature and sunshine duration on the ET0, where the first-order sensitivity coefficients were less than 0.01. Therefore, an optimal combination of four meteorological parameters was constructed for the improved model. The overall performance of the BO-ELM model in the test accuracy was better than those of the BO-SVR and BO-RF models. The highest accuracy was achieved for the BO-ELM model using the optimal combination of average relative humidity, average wind speed, the maximum temperature, and average temperature, particularly with the R2, RMSE, and MAE of 0.928, 0.069 mm/d, and 0.046 mm/d, respectively. The BO-ELM model was also well adapted to estimate the ET0 in the facility with a small number of meteorological parameters (average relative humidity, and average wind speed), with the R2, RMSE, and MAE of 0.910, 0.078 mm/d, and 0.057 mm/d, respectively. The computational cost of each estimation model was calculated from the parameter tuning time and modeling time of the model. Overall, the BO-SVR and BO-ELM models presented relatively short running time of 0.97 and 2.22 s, respectively. By contrast, the longest running time of 27.46 s was obtained in the BO-RF model. Therefore, the BO-ELM model can be expected to serve as the ET0 estimation in the shading facility in the absence of some meteorological parameters, fully considering the calculation accuracy and cost of the simulation. The findings can also provide an effective way for the estimation of ET0 in the shading facilities. © 2022 Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

Automated machine learning (AutoML), a substantially progressive machine learning (ML) paradigm, expedites the data science applications in these domains by automating and alleviating the tedious tasks of developing ML pipelines, particularly in non-linear hydrological process modelling. This paper proposes an AutoML solution for daily EToprediction in a limited input parameter scenario, for the first time in EToestimation research. Two AutoML frameworks, AutoGluon-Tabular (AGT) and H2O AutoML were implemented using daily meteorological data of a humid tropical climatic region of Kerala, India and evaluated its performance with the radiation-based empirical methods and traditional ML methods. The developed AutoML models imitated the input parameter combinations of radiation-based empirical models such as Priestley-Taylor, Makkink, Turc and Ritchie, with the Penman-Monteith EToserving as the target for modelling process. An improvement of mean absolute error from 0.119 to 0.078 mm/day, mean squared error from 0.035 to 0.017 mm/day, root mean squared error from 0.186 to 0.129 mm/day, root mean squared logarithmic error from 0.078 to 0.026 mm/day, and coefficient of determination (R2) from 0.971 to 0.985 observed in the AutoML model, AGT relative to the empirical model, Turc describes its enhanced performance capability. For demonstrating the superiority of AutoML to traditional ML techniques, another set of AutoML models were also developed based on California Irrigation Management Information System datasets and evaluated them with existing study results in literature. The overall result analysis demonstrated the superiority of AGT model in EToprediction in all the weather stations considered in this study. The results of the study confirm that AutoML techniques can be applied to any hydrological dataset and provide an effective automated solution for hydrological process modelling. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",AutoGluon-tabular; AutoML; deep learning; H2O; machine learning; reference evapotranspiration,India; Kerala; Automation; Cost effectiveness; Deep learning; Errors; Evapotranspiration; Mean square error; Process engineering; Autogluon-tabular; Automated machine learning; Automated solutions; Deep learning; H2O; Hydrological process; Input parameter; Machine learning models; Process-models; Reference evapotranspiration; automation; empirical analysis; evapotranspiration; humid environment; machine learning; numerical model; prediction; tropical region; Information management,Yes,Yes,"weather station, empirical models","climate & meteorology, vegetation indices",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0

There-fore, the accurate estimation of ETo is essential for optimal utilization of available water resources on regional and global scales. The present study was conducted to estimate the monthly ETo at Nagina (Uttar Pradesh State) and Pantnagar (Uttarakhand State) stations by employing the three ML (machine learning) techniques including the SVM (support vector machine), M5P (M5P model tree), and RF (random forest) against the three empirical models (i.e., Valiantzas-1: V-1, Valiantzas-2: V-2, Valiantzas-3: V-3). Three different input combinations (i.e., C-1, C-2, C-3) were formulated by using 8-year (2009–2016) climatic data of wind speed (u), solar radiation (Rs), relative humidity (RH), and mean air temperature (T) recorded at both stations. The predictive efficacy of ML and the empirical models was evaluated based on five statistical indicators i.e., CC (correlation coefficient), WI (Willmott index), EC (efficiency coefficient), RMSE (root mean square error), and MAE (mean absolute error) presented through a heatmap along with graphical interpretation (Taylor diagram, time-series, and scatter plots). The results showed that the SVM-1 model corresponding to the C-1 input combination outperformed the other ML and empirical models at both stations. Moreover, the SVM-1 model had the lowest MAE (0.076, 0.047 mm/month) and RMSE (0.110, 0.063 mm/month), and highest EC (0.995, 0.999), CC (0.998, 0.999), and WI (0.999, 1.000) values during validation period at Nagina and Pantnagar stations, respectively, and closely followed by the M5P model. Consequently, the ML model (i.e., SVM) was found to be more robust, and reliable in monthly ETo estimation and can be used as a promising alternative to empirical models at both study locations. © 2022 by the authors.

Subsequently, LAI is often a critical data input to various evapotranspiration, hydrological and climatic models. While LAI data can generally be easily obtained, it is seldom available at spatio-temporal scales that can be used to guide and inform management decisions for localised applications. To this end, we propose a methodology to acquire moderate resolution LAI (LAIMR) estimates from freely available satellite-earth observation data sets and data processing platforms. Fifteen sites distributed within the KwaZulu-Natal and Mpumalanga provinces of South Africa were selected as study areas. Coarse spatial resolution MODIS LAI and vegetation index (VI) products were acquired for each of these sites to establish the LAI-VI relationship which was then used to develop machine learning-based models (MLBMs) to estimate LAIMR using VIs derived from Landsat or Sentinel-2 data. During the validation and testing phases of the study, LAI estimates were compared against the corresponding MODIS LAI product values. The results of these investigations demonstrated that MLBMs performed satisfactorily across the majority of the study sites, producing correlation coefficients ranging from 0.62 to 0.97 and 0.29–0.84 for the validation and testing phases, respectively. The poorer performance of the MLBMs when using VIs derived from Landsat or Sentinel-2 data can be largely attributed to inherent limitations associated with the proposed methodology, such as i) the lack of moderate-high spatial resolution LAI records that could be used for training and testing purposes and ii) saturation effects associated with the use of VIs. Notwithstanding these limitations, the proposed methodology has been shown to be flexible and robust and can be a useful approach to acquire LAIMR estimates with fairly reasonable accuracy in data limited circumstances. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Commercial forestry; Google earth engine; LAI; Machine learning; Vegetation indices,,Yes,Yes,remote sensing,"climate & meteorology, vegetation indices",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0

The objective in this study was to characterize and forecast water stress in the Hyderabad region of India using artificial intelligence models. The monthly precipitation data for the period 1982–2021 was characterized by the standardized precipitation index (SPI) and modeled using the classical autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model and artificial intelligence (AI), i.e., artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector regression (SVR) model. The results show that on the short-term SPI3 time scale the studied region experienced extreme water deficit in 1983, 1992, 1993, 2007, 2015, and 2018, while on the mid-term SPI6 time scale, 1983, 1991, 2011, and 2016 were extremely dry. In addition, the prediction of drought at both SPI3 and SPI6 time scales by AI models outperformed the classical ARIMA models in both, training and validation data sets. Among applied models, the SVR model performed better than other models in modeling and predicting drought (confirmed by root mean square error—RMSE), while the Diebold–Mariano test confirmed that SVR output was significantly superior. A reduction in the prediction error of SVR by 48% and 32% (vs. ARIMA), and by 21% and 26% (vs. ANN) was observed in the test data sets for both SPI3 and SPI6 time scales. These results may be due to the ability of the SVR model to account for the nonlinear and complex patterns in the input data sets against the classical linear ARIMA model. These results may contribute to more sustainable and efficient management of water resources/stress in cropping systems. © 2022 by the authors.

By considering the key relationship between the size of cracks and the moisture content, we observed that low moisture contents act as an important driver in the cracking mechanism. In addition, factors which control the deformation at low moisture content were seen to be important. Factors that affect susceptibility to cracking were proposed. These factors are precipitation, evapotranspiration, soil subsidence, grass color, soil type, peat layer thickness, soil stiffness and levee orientation. Statistics show that the cumulative precipitation deficit is best associated with the occurrence of the cracks (cracks are characterized by higher precipitation deficits). Model tree classification algorithms were used to predict whether a given input of the factors can lead to cracking. The performance of a model predicting long cracks was evaluated with a Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) of 0.31, while a model predicting cracks in general was evaluated with an MCC of 0.51. Evaluation of the model trees indicated that the peat thickness, the soil stiffness and the orientation of the levee can be used to determine crack-proneness of the levees.

In this work, a recent state-of-the-art architecture has been adapted and deployed for multivariate input time series forecasting (transformers) using past values of ET0 and temperature-based parameters (28 input configurations) to forecast daily ET0 up to a week (1 to 7 days). Additionally, it has been compared to standard machine learning models such as multilayer perceptron (MLP), random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), extreme learning machine (ELM), convolutional neural network (CNN), long short-term memory (LSTM), and two baselines (historical monthly mean value and a moving average of the previous seven days) in five locations with different geo-climatic characteristics in the Andalusian region, Southern Spain. In general, machine learning models significantly outperformed the baselines. Furthermore, the ac-curacy dramatically dropped when forecasting ET0 for any horizon longer than three days. SVM, ELM, and RF using configurations I, III, IV, and IX outperformed, on average, the rest of the configurations in most cases. The best NSE values ranged from 0.934 in Córdoba to 0.869 in Tabernas, using SVM. The best RMSE, on average, ranged from 0.704 mm/day for Málaga to 0.883 mm/day for Conil using RF. In terms of MBE, most models and cases performed very accurately, with a total average performance of 0.011 mm/day. We found a relationship in performance regarding the aridity index and the distance to the sea. The higher the aridity index at inland locations, the better results were obtained in forecasts. On the other hand, for coastal sites, the higher the aridity index, the higher the error. Due to the good performance and the availability as an open-source repository of these models, they can be used to accurately forecast ET0 in different geo-climatic conditions, helping to increase efficiency in tasks of great agronomic importance, especially in areas with low rainfall or where water resources are limiting for the development of crops. © 2022 by the authors.

However, due to the data-hungry nature of the machine learning models, all of these researches are not suitable for regions with limited data supply. This study aims to provide a breakthrough for the bottleneck through coupling of the inter-model ensemble with various data management schemes. The Bayesian modeling approach and a non-linear neural ensemble based inter-model ensemble (BMA-E and NNE-E) were developed locally with data from five different meteorological stations in the Peninsular Malaysia. The NNE-E was found to be highly robust spatially, whereby it can be used to estimate daily ETo accurately at other stations, even though with reduced input meteorological parameters. However, the performances of the locally trained models were found wanting and were fluctuating violently. This was resolved through creating a data pool that include the data from all stations and developing a universal NNE. By following the proposed scheme of things, the daily ETo can be easily estimated across the whole Peninsular Malaysia. This being, without the need for historical data and new models at estimation site. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Bayesian modeling approach; Exogenous data; Hybrid models; Limited data; Non-linear neural ensemble,Evapotranspiration; Information management; Machine learning; Bayesian modeling approach; Bayesian modelling; Exogenous data; Hybrid model; Limited data; Model ensembles; Modeling approach; Neural ensembles; Non linear; Non-linear neural ensemble; Bayesian networks,Yes,Yes,weather station,"climate & meteorology, vegetation indices",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0

The Penman–Monteith method recommended by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO PM56) is widely used and considered a standard to calculate ETo. However, FAO PM56 cannot be used with limited meteorological variables, so it is compulsory to choose an alternative model for ETo estimation, which requires fewer variables. This study built ten machine learning (ML) models based on multi-function, neural network, and tree-based structure against the FAO PM56 method. For this purpose, time series temperature data on a monthly scale are only used to train ML models. The developed ML models were applied to estimate ETo at different test stations and the obtained results were compared with the FAO PM56 method to verify and validate their performance in ETo estimation for the selected stations. In addition, multiple statistical indicators, including root-mean-square error (RMSE), coefficient of determination (R2), mean absolute error (MAE), Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), and correlation coefficient (r) were calculated to compare the performance of each ML model on ETo estimation. Among the applied ML models, the ETo tree boost (TB) ML model outperformed the other ML models in estimating ETo in diverse climatic conditions based on statistical indicators (R2, NSE, r, RMSE, and MAE). Moreover, the observed R2, NSE, and r were the highest for the TB ML model, while RMSE and MAE were found to be the lowest at the study sites compared to other applied ML models. Lastly, ETo point data yielded from the TB ML model was used in an interpolation process to create monthly and annual ETo maps. Based on the ETo maps, this study suggests mainly a focus on areas with high ETo values and proper irrigation scheduling of crops to ensure water sustainability. © 2022 by the authors.

ETo can be accurately determined using the internationally accepted FAO Penman–Monteith (FAO-56 PM) equation. However, this requires numerous observed data, including solar radiation, air temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed, which in most cases are unavailable, particularly in developing countries such as the Philippines. This study developed models based on Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Extreme Learning Machines (ELMs) for the estimation of daily ETo using different input combinations of meteorological data in Region IV-A, Philippines. The performance of machine learning models was compared with the different established alternative empirical models for ETo. The results show that the SVM and ELM models, with at least Tmax, Tmin, and Rs as inputs, provide the best daily ETo estimates. The accuracy of machine learning models was also found to be superior compared to the empirical models given with same input require-ments.

Few tools or soil tests exist to help managers guide N fertilizer decisions. Turf growth prediction models have the potential to be useful, but the lone turfgrass growth prediction model only takes into account temperature, limiting its accuracy. This study investigated the ability of a machine learning (ML)-based turf growth model using the random forest (RF) algorithm (ML-RF model) to improve creeping bentgrass (Agrostis stolonifera) putting green management by estimating short-term clipping yield. This method was compared against three alternative N application strategies including (1) PACE Turf growth potential (GP) model, (2) an experience-based method for applying N fertilizer (experience-based method), and (3) the experience-based method guided by a vegetative index, normalized difference red edge (NDRE)-based method. The ML-RF model was built based on a set of variables including 7-day weather, evapotranspiration (ET), traffic intensity, soil moisture content, N fertilization rate, NDRE, and root zone type. The field experiment was conducted on two sand-based research greens in 2020 and 2021. The cumulative applied N fertilizer was 281 kg ha−1 for the PACE Turf GP model, 190 kg ha−1 for the experience-based method, 140 kg ha−1 for the ML-RF model, and around 75 kg ha−1 NDRE-based method. ML-RF model and NDRE-based method were able to provide customized N fertilization recommendations on different root zones. The methods resulted in different mean turfgrass qualities and NDRE. From highest to lowest, they were PACE Turf GP model, experience-based, ML-RF model, and NDRE-based method, and the first three methods produced turfgrass quality over 7 (on a scale from 1 to 9) and NDRE value over 0.30. N fertilization guided by the ML-RF model resulted in a moderate amount of fertilizer applied and acceptable turfgrass performance characteristics. This application strategy is based on the N cycle and has the potential to assist turfgrass managers in making N fertilization decisions for creeping bentgrass putting greens.

The Penman–Monteith (PM) model of Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) model requires a number of meteorological parameters; it is urgent to develop high-precision and computationally efficient ET0 models with fewer parameter inputs. This study proposed the genetic algorithm (GA) to optimize extreme learning machine (ELM), and evaluated the performances of ELM, GA-ELM, and empirical models for estimating daily ET0 in Southwest China. Daily meteorological data including maximum temperature (Tmax), minimum temperature (Tmin), wind speed (u2), relative humidity (RH), net radiation  (Rn), and global solar radiation (Rs) during 1992–2016 from meteorological stations were used for model training and testing. The results from the FAO-56 Penman–Monteith formula were used as a control group. The results showed that GA-ELM models (with R2 ranging 0.71–0.99, RMSE ranging 0.036–0.77 mm·d−1) outperformed the standalone ELM models (with R2 ranging 0.716–0.99, RMSE ranging 0.08–0.77 mm·d−1) during training and testing, both of which were superior to empirical models (with R2 ranging 0.36–0.91, RMSE ranging 0.69–2.64 mm·d−1). ET0 prediction accuracy varies with different input combination models. The machine learning models using Tmax, Tmin, u2, RH, and Rn/Rs (GA-ELM5/GA-ELM4 and ELM5/ELM4) obtained the best ET0 estimates, with R2 ranging 0.98–0.99, RMSE ranging 0.03–0.21 mm·d−1, followed by models with Tmax, Tmin, and Rn/Rs (GA-ELM3/GA-ELM2 and ELM3/ELM2) as inputs. The machine learning models involved with Rn outperformed those with Rs when the quantity of input parameters was the same. Overall, GA-ELM5 (Tmax, Tmin, u2, RH and Rn as inputs) outperformed the other models during training and testing, and was thus recommended for daily ET0 estimation. With the estimation accuracy, computational costs, and availability of input parameters accounted, GA-ELM2 (Tmax, Tmin, and Rs as inputs) was determined to be the most effective model for estimating daily ET0 with limited meteorological data in Southwest China. © 2022 by the authors.

The main objective of this study is to verify the suitability of machine learning (ML) models as calculation methods for pan evaporation modeling on the macro-regional scale. The most significant PE changes in the different agroclimatic zones of the Slovak Republic were compared, and their considerable impacts were analyzed. On the basis of the agroclimatic zones, 35 meteorological stations distributed across Slovakia were classified into six macro-regions. For each of the meteorological stations, 11 variables were applied during the vegetation period in the years from 2010 to 2020 with a daily time step.

For the prediction of winter wheat yields, we incorporated climatological data and daily crop water requirements (CWR), Sentinel-2 time series, and the derived indices such as the normalised difference red edge (NDRE), red edge inflection point (REIP) and the normalized difference water index (NDWI). These factors were evaluated by using stepwise linear regression (LR) and random forest (RF). Robust field data sets from 2016 to 2018 with weighed yields from three regions in southern Germany in the range of 49 dt ha−1 to 102 dt ha−1 were used for calibration and validation. Indices reflecting the field variability were not better suited for yield prediction than climatological data alone. A new approach using all raw bands of Sentinel-2 in combination with evapotranspiration and precipitation, delivered a reduced number of features and explained 84% of the yield variance with a RMSE of 5.6 dt ha−1. Alternatively, the NDWI-based CWR merged all significant parameters into one feature and explained 79% of the variance with a RMSE of 6.46 dt ha−1.

The daily data of minimum temperature (Tmin), maximum temperature (Tmax), mean temperature (Tmean), solar radiation (SR), humidity (H), wind speed (WS), sunshine hours (Ssh), maximum global radiation (gradmax), minimum global radiation (gradmin), day length, and ETo data were obtained over the long-term period from 1969 to 2019. The analysed data were divided into two parts from 1969 to 2007 and from 2008 to 2019 for model training and testing, respectively.

In this study, performance of a base artificial intelligence (AI) model, adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), and its hybrids with two bio-inspired optimization algorithms, namely shuffled frog leaping algorithm (SFLA) and grey wolf optimization (GWO), in estimating monthly AET was evaluated over 2001–2010 across Neishaboor watershed in Iran. The inputs of these models were categorized into three groups including meteorological, remotely sensed, and hybrid-based predictors, and defined in the form of 8 different scenarios. Net radiation (Rn), land surface temperature (LST), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), and soil wetness deficit index (SWDI) were the remotely sensed predictors, computed using MODIS satellite images on the monthly scale for the study area. The results showed that the SWDI predictor has played a significant role in improving the accuracy of AET estimation, with the highest error reduction (12.5, 17 and 26.5% for ANFIS, ANFIS-SFLA, and ANFIS-GWO, respectively) obtained under scenarios including SWDI compared to corresponding scenarios excluding this predictor. In testing set, the three aforementioned models exhibited their best performance under Scenario 8 (RMSE = 11.93, NSE = 0.69, RRMSE = 0.37), Scenario 4 (RMSE = 11.06, NSE = 0.74, RRMSE = 0.37) and Scenario 4 (RMSE = 10.9, NSE = 0.76, RRMSE = 0.36), respectively. Coupling the SFLA and GWO optimization algorithms to the base model improved the accuracy of AET estimation, with the maximum error reduction for the two algorithms being about 12% (Scenarios 2 and 4) and 14% (Scenario 4), respectively. Examining the performance of the best scenarios of the three models in three intervals including the first, middle, and last third of measured AET values showed that all models were the most accurate in the first third interval.

In the urban context, such adaptation strategies require a thorough understanding of the built-up response to the incoming solar radiation, i.e., the urban energy balance cycle and its implications for the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect. Despite readily available, diurnal Land Surface Temperature (LST) data does not provide a meaningful picture of the UHI, in these midlatitudes FUAs. On the contrary, the mid-morning satellite overpass is characterized by the absence of a significant surface UHI (SUHI) signal, corresponding to the period of the day when the urban-rural air temperature difference is typically negative. Conversely, nocturnal high-resolution LST data is rarely available. In this study, an energy balance-based machine learning approach is explored, considering the Local Climate Zones (LCZ), to describe the daily cycle of the heat flux components and predict the nocturnal SUHI, during an HW event. While the urban and rural spatial outlines are not visible in the diurnal thermal image, they become apparent in the latent and storage heat flux maps – built-up infrastructures uptake heat during the day which is released back into the atmosphere, during the night, whereas vegetation land surfaces loose diurnal heat through evapotranspiration. For the LST prediction model, a random forest (RF) approach is implemented. RF results show that the model accurately predicts the LST, ensuring mean square errors inferior to 0.1 K. Both the latent and storage heat flux components, together with LCZ classification, are the most important explanatory variables for the nocturnal LST prediction, supporting the adoption of the energy balance approach. In future research, other locations and time-series data shall be trained and tested, providing an efficient local urban climate monitoring tool, where in-situ air temperature observations are not available. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Heatwave; Land surface temperature; Local climate zones; Multisensor data fusion; Random forest; Satellite thermal imagery; Urban climate adaptation; Urban Heat Island,Cities; Environmental Monitoring; Hot Temperature; Machine Learning; Temperature; Campania [Italy]; Italy; Naples; Napoli [Campania]; Atmospheric temperature; Data fusion; Decision trees; Digital storage; Forecasting; Heat flux; Land surface temperature; Landforms; Machine learning; Mean square error; Satellite imagery; Surface measurement; Surface properties; Heatwaves; Local climate; Local climate zone; Multi sensors data fusion; Random forests; Satellite thermal imagery; Thermal imagery; Urban climate adaptation; Urban climates; Urban heat island; energy balance; heat island; heat wave; land surface; machine learning; prediction; satellite imagery; surface temperature; adoption; air temperature; article; atmosphere; climate; energy balance; evapotranspiration; explanatory variable; heat wave; imagery; night; prediction; random forest; time series analysis; vegetation; city; environmental monitoring; heat; machine learning; temperature; Energy balance,Yes,Yes,remote sensing,"climate & meteorology, vegetation indices",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0

Land-surface models can provide a valuable alternative for simulating soil moisture dynamics, but only a few countries have such modelling schemes implemented for monitoring soil moisture at high spatial resolution. In this study, a soil moisture accounting model (SMA) was regionalized over the Iberian Peninsula, taking as a reference the soil moisture simulated by a high-resolution land-surface model. To estimate the soil water holding capacity, the sole parameter required to run the SMA model, two approaches were compared: the direct estimation from European soil maps using pedotransfer functions or an indirect estimation by a machine learning approach, random forests, using as predictors altitude, temperature, precipitation, potential evapotranspiration and land use. Results showed that the random forest model estimates are more robust, especially for estimating low soil moisture levels. Consequently, the proposed approach can provide an efficient way to simulate daily soil moisture and therefore monitor soil moisture droughts, in contexts where high-resolution soil maps are not available, as it relies on a set of covariates that can be reliably estimated from global databases. © 2022 Yves Tramblay.",,Iberian Peninsula; drought; machine learning; monitoring; soil moisture; soil water,Yes,Yes,Not Specified,"climate & meteorology, soil",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0

For daily predictions, the LSTM model’s accuracy was compared to that of other artificial intelligence-based models commonly used in ET0 forecasting, including support vector regression (SVR), M5 model tree (M5Tree), multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS), probabilistic linear regression (PLR), adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), and Gaussian process regression (GPR). The LSTM model outperformed the other models in a comparison based on Shannon’s entropy-based decision theory, while the M5 tree and PLR models proved to be the lowest performers. Prior to performing a multi-step-ahead forecasting, ANFIS, sequence-to-sequence regression LSTM network (SSR-LSTM), LSTM, and Bi-LSTM approaches were used for one-step-ahead forecasting utilizing the past values of the ET0 time series. The results showed that the Bi-LSTM model outperformed other models and that the sequence of models in ascending order in terms of accuracies was Bi-LSTM > SSR-LSTM > ANFIS > LSTM. The Bi-LSTM model provided multi-step (5 day)-ahead ET0 forecasting in the next step. According to the results, the Bi-LSTM provided reasonably accurate and acceptable forecasting of multi-step-forward ET0 with relatively lower levels of forecasting errors. In the final step, the generalization capability of the proposed best models (LSTM for daily predictions and Bi-LSTM for multi-step-ahead forecasting) was evaluated on new unseen data obtained from a test station, Ishurdi. The model’s performance was assessed on three distinct datasets (the entire dataset and the first and the second halves of the entire dataset) derived from the test dataset between 1 January 2015 and 31 December 2020. The results indicated that the deep learning techniques (LSTM and Bi-LSTM) achieved equally good performances as the training station dataset, for which the models were developed. The research outcomes demonstrated the ability of the developed deep learning models to generalize the prediction capabilities outside the training station. © 2022 by the authors.

1054,Bonsoms J.; Boulet G.,Ensemble Machine Learning Outperforms Empirical Equations for the Ground Heat Flux Estimation with Remote Sensing Data,2022,10.3390/rs14081788,"Estimating evapotranspiration at the field scale is a major component of sustainable water management. Due to the difficulty to assess some major unknowns of the water cycle at that scale, including irrigation amounts, evapotranspiration is often computed as the residual of the instantaneous surface energy budget. One of the Surface Energy Balance components with the largest un-certainties in their quantification over bare soils and sparse vegetation areas is the ground heat flux (G). Over the last decades, the estimation of G with remote sensing (RS) data has been mainly achieved with empirical equations, on the basis of the G and net radiation (Rn) ratio, G/Rn. The G/Rn empirical equations generally require vegetation data (Type I empirical equations), in combi-nation with surface temperature (Ts) and albedo (Type II empirical equations). In this article, we aim to evaluate the estimation of G with RS data. Here, we compared eight G/Rn empirical equations against two types of machine learning (ML) methods: an ensemble ML type, the Random Forest (RF), and the Neural Networks (NN). The comparison of each method was evaluated using a wide range of climate and land cover datasets, including data from Eddy-Covariance towers that extend along the mid-latitude areas that encompass the European and African continents. Our results have shown evidence that the driver of G in bare soils and sparse vegetation areas (Fraction of Vegetation, Fv ≤ 0.25) is Ts, instead of vegetation greenness indexes. On the other hand, the accuracy in the estimation of G with Rn, Ts or Fv decreases in densely vegetated areas (Fv ≥ 0.50). There are no significant differences between the most accurate Type I and II empirical equations. For bare soils and sparse vegetation areas the empirical equation which combines the Leaf Area Index (LAI) and Ts (E7) estimates G best. In densely vegetated areas, an exponential empirical equation based on Fv (E4), shows the best performance. However, ML better estimates G than the empirical equa-tions, independently of the Fv ranges. An RF model with Rn, LAI and Ts as predictor variables shows the best accuracy and performance metrics, outperforming the NN model. © 2022 by the authors.

Monthly precipitation and temperature data from 1960 to 2019 were used. In temperate climates, such as the north of Iran, the correlation coefficients of SPI and SPEI were 0.94, 0.95, and 0.81 at the time scales of 3, 12, and 48 months, respectively. Besides, this correlation coefficient was 0.47, 0.35, and 0.44 in arid and hot climates, such as the southwest of Iran because potential evapotranspiration (PET) depends on temperature more than rainfall. Drought was predicted using the random forest (RF) model and applying 1–12 months lag times for next time. By increasing the time scale, the prediction accuracy of SPI and SPEI will improve. The ability of SPEI is more than SPI for drought prediction, because the overall accuracy (OA) of prediction will increase, and the errors (i.e., overestimate (OE) and underestimate (UE)) will reduce. It is recommended for future studies (1) using wavelet analysis for improving accuracy of predictions and (2) using the Penman–Monteith method if ground-based data are available. © 2022 The Authors.",drought indices; drought monitoring; drought prediction; random forest,Iran; Climate models; Decision trees; Evapotranspiration; Forecasting; Best model; Correlation coefficient; Drought index; Drought monitoring; Drought prediction; Lag-time; Random forest modeling; Random forests; Standardized precipitation index; Time-scales; drought; evapotranspiration; machine learning; monitoring; Penman-Monteith equation; precipitation (climatology); prediction; Drought,Yes,Yes,"field measurement, empirical models",climate & meteorology,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

This study aimed to assess its performance at the monthly level using four ground measurements in a tropical watershed system with complex topography, applying a machine learning artificial neural network (ANN) to improve the estimates, and using the ANN-adjusted MODIS-16 PET to characterize the spatio-temporal patterns of PET in the Brantas watershed, as well as to under-stand the monthly patterns of water deficiency in areas under eight different vegetation covers. The results showed that the native MODIS-16 PET experienced overestimation with an RMSE of 37–66 mm/month and NRSME of up to 33%. The performance decreased in drier periods. The ANN-based adjustment using only one variable showed improved estimates with a reduction of RSME to only 14 mm and lower than 10% NRMSE. Sari-temporal patterns of PET in the Brantas watershed showed that the PET characteristics were not uniform. The southern part of the Brantas watershed has areas with relatively lower PET that are, thus, more prone to water deficiency. Complex topography and climate gradients within the watershed apparently became the multi-controllers of PET variations. The difference in vegetation cover also influenced the magnitudes of water deficiency. © 2022 by the authors.

It is a high demand to predict the PET changes for the robust responsive strategies to the future climate scenarios in northwest China. However, the projected outcomes cannot fully match the decision-making on the planning, due to the uncertainties originating from different sources. Therefore, it is crucial to develop a large-scale ensemble of PET projections, considering the multiple sources of uncertainty to quantify the contribution of each uncertainty source. In this research, a monthly regression correction was carried out on the simplified PET models (temperature- and machine learning-based PET models) using historical meteorological data. A three-dimensional evaluation framework was then constructed to predict the PET changes using the meteorological data of 6 Global Climate Models (GCMs) in the sixth Phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6), 3 future scenarios (Shared Socioeconomic Pathways, SSPs), and 6 PET models (2 combined and 4 simplified PET models). A large-scale ensemble projection was obtained, including 108 projections of annual and seasonal PET changes (△PET). The △PETs in the mid-term future and long-term future were obtained to subtract the average PET in the historical period from 2041 to 2070, and from 2071 to 2100, respectively. The different forecasts of climate scenarios (SSPs), PET models (PETMs), and GCMs were quantified to determine the multiple sources of uncertainty on the projection. Three-factor Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was selected to quantify the contribution rate of each uncertainty source and the interactions to the total uncertainty. The result showed that: 1) The correction coefficients in the PET models after the monthly regression were represented the influence of meteorological elements (except for the temperature), indicating an improved simulation accuracy of the simplified PET models with the reduced systematic error. It infers that the regional modified and combined PET models were more reasonable than ever to evaluate the PET changes. 2) In the mid-term future (2041-2070) and the long-term future (2071-2100), the ensemble projected average values of the annual △PET were 67.8 and 95.3 mm, respectively, where the variances of projection were 17.6 and 21.4 mm, respectively. The SSP5-8.5 scenario, random forest, and ACCESS-ESM1-5 model were tended to produce the larger values in the ensemble projection, while it was smaller using SSP1-2.6 scenario, PM[CO2] and MIROC6 model. In addition, there was the increased variation in the forecast outcomes caused by the uncertainties from the SSP and PETM over time. 3) The importance of various sources of uncertainty in the PET ensemble projection was ranked in the descending order of PETM, SSP, and GCM in the mid-term future. The SSP was the most important source of uncertainty with a contribution rate of 65.3% in the long-term future. Meanwhile, the contribution rates of PETM and GCM were reduced to 19.1% and 7.7%, respectively. In terms of seasonal distribution, the PETM and SSP presented a higher contribution rate to the total uncertainty in the warm seasons (summer, autumn) and cold seasons (winter, spring), respectively. Therefore, the large-scale ensemble projection with enough samples and the statistical characteristics can be widely expected to serve a more comprehensive evaluation than before, particularly for climate change. The findings can provide a potential direction to reduce the uncertainty of future PET assessments. © 2022, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

As the most direct signal of drought, evapotranspiration deserves a more systematic and comprehensive study. Further depicting their divergence of potential (ETp) and actual evapotranspiration (ETa) will help to explore the limitation of evapotranspiration. In this paper, the multi-source remote sensing datasets from the Climate Research Unit (CRU), Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and its follow-on experiment (GRACE-FO), the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS), and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) during 2002 to 2020 were employed to explore the influence of meteorological, hydrological and botanical factors on ETp, ETa and their divergence – reduction of evapotranspiration (Er) which represents regional vegetation and water limitations. According to the Pearson correlation analysis and the Boruta Algorithm based on Random Forest, the temperature is the first decisive promoter of evapotranspiration in the most area while the sparse vegetation is the primary or second determinant limiting the evapotranspiration in 61.84% of the world. In addition, the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) data from 2030 to 2090 and the support vector machine regression (SVMR) model were applied to predict the future global ETp, ETa and Er on the pixel scale. Predicted results of the model considering the water change not only can highly improve the model performance (with higher R2), but also can simulate the drought in Europe and the more intense ETa in Africa. Thus, Er proposed in this study provide a good reference for regional ETa except for ETp. The future evapotranspiration value derived by introducing the water storage changes into the machine learning model in this study is also valuable for climate change adaptation and drought warning. © 2021 The Authors",Actual evapotranspiration; Hydrological factors; Machine learning model; Multi-source remote sensing products; Potential evapotranspiration,Climate Change; Droughts; Satellite Imagery; Temperature; Water; Climate change; Climate models; Correlation methods; Decision trees; Digital storage; Drought; Evapotranspiration; Support vector machines; Vegetation; Water supply; water; Actual evapotranspiration; Direct signal; Gravity recovery and climate experiments; Hydrological factors; Machine learning models; Multi-source remote sensing product; Multi-Sources; Potential evapotranspiration; Remote-sensing; Vegetation change; climate change; CMIP; drought; extreme event; GRACE; hydrological response; machine learning; MODIS; pixel; potential evapotranspiration; remote sensing; support vector machine; vegetation dynamics; Article; climate change; drought; evapotranspiration; geographic distribution; hydrology; mathematical computing; meteorological phenomena; random forest; remote sensing; support vector machine; temperature measurement; vegetation; water quality; satellite imagery; temperature; Remote sensing,Yes,Yes,"weather station, remote sensing",climate & meteorology,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

With advances in hyperspectral imaging sensor, fast, non-invasive and non-destructive measurements of a plant's physiological status became feasible. In this work, a non-destructive method for the characterization of a plant's status from hyperspectral images is presented. A supervised data-driven method based on Machine Learning Regression (MLR) algorithms was developed to generate prediction models of four targeted physiological traits: water potential, effective quantum yield of photosystem II, transpiration rate and stomatal conductance. Standard Normal Variate (SNV) transformed reflectance spectra were used as the input variables for building the regression model. Three MLR algorithms: Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR), and Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) were explored as candidate methods for building the prediction model of the targeted physiological traits. Validation results show that the non-linear prediction models, developed based on the GPR algorithm produced the best estimation accuracy on all plant traits. The best prediction models were applied to a small-scale phenotyping experiment to study drought stress responses in maize plants. Results show that all estimated traits revealed a significant difference between plants under drought stress and normal growth dynamics as early as after 3 days of drought induction. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Drought stress; Hyperspectral imaging; Machine learning regression; Non-destructive measurements; Physiological traits; Plant phenotyping,Forecasting; Learning algorithms; Least squares approximations; Machine learning; Nondestructive examination; Physiological models; Physiology; Regression analysis; Spectroscopy; Drought stress; Gaussian process regression; Machine learning regression; Machine-learning; Non-destructive analysis; Non-destructive measurement; Physiological trait; Plant phenotyping; Prediction modelling; Regression algorithms; drought stress; ground penetrating radar; imaging method; model validation; regression analysis; spatiotemporal analysis; Hyperspectral imaging,Yes,Yes,"remote sensing, phenotyping","vegetation indices, plant physiology",0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1

Their dual vegetation strata, the grass-dominated understory and tree-dominated overstory, make for distinct structural, physiological and phenological characteristics, which challenge models compared to more homogeneous and energy-limited ecosystems. Along with this, the contribution of grasses and trees to total transpiration (T), along with their different climatic drivers, is still largely unknown nor quantified in TGEs. This study proposes a thermal-based three-source energy balance (3SEB) model, accommodating an additional vegetation source within the well-known two-source energy balance (TSEB) model. The model was implemented at both tower and continental scales using eddy-covariance (EC) TGE sites, with variable tree canopy cover and rainfall (P) regimes and Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) images. 3SEB robustly simulated latent heat (LE) and related energy fluxes in all sites (Tower: LE RMSD ~60 W/m2; MSG: LE RMSD ~90 W/m2), improving over both TSEB and seasonally changing TSEB (TSEB-2S) models. In addition, 3SEB inherently partitions water fluxes between the tree, grass and soil sources. The modelled T correlated well with EC T estimates (r >.76), derived from a machine learning ET partitioning method. The T/ET was found positively related to both P and leaf area index, especially compared to the decomposed grass understory T/ET. However, trees and grasses had contrasting relations with respect to monthly P. These results demonstrate the importance in decomposing total ET into the different vegetation sources, as they have distinct climatic drivers, and hence, different relations to seasonal water availability. These promising results improved ET and energy flux estimations over complex TGEs, which may contribute to enhance global drought monitoring and understanding, and their responses to climate change feedbacks. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",,Ecosystem; Poaceae; Remote Sensing Technology; Soil; Trees; Water; water; energy balance; estimation method; evapotranspiration; global perspective; leaf area index; Meteosat; phenology; physiology; remote sensing; semiarid region; terrestrial ecosystem; transpiration; uncertainty analysis; understory; water availability; ecosystem; physiology; Poaceae; remote sensing; soil; tree,Yes,Yes,remote sensing,"climate & meteorology, vegetation indices, plant physiology",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1

Here we quantified relationships between drought and 23 drought factors using remote sensing data during the period of 2002–2016. Based on the Gradient Boosting Algorithm (GBM), we found that precipitation and soil moisture had relatively large contributions to droughts. During the growing season, the relative importance of Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI-7) for SPEI3, SPEI6, SPEI9, and SPEI12 reached as high as 50%. However, during the non-growing season, the Snow Cover Fraction (SCF) had larger fractional relative importance for short-term droughts in the Inner Mongolia and the Loess Plateau which can reach as high as 10%. We also compared Extremely Randomized Trees (ERT), H2O-based Deep Learning (Model developed by H2O.deep learning in R H2O.DL), and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) for drought prediction at various time scales, and found that the ERT model had the highest prediction performance with R2 > 0.72.

Direct approaches for estimating reference evapotranspiration (ET0) are either difficult or need a large number of inputs that are not always available from meteorological stations.

ET0 was estimated using the FAO-56 Penman–Monteith (FAO56PM) equation and observed meteorological data. The estimated ET0 using FAO56PM was then used as the target output for the machine learning models, while the observed meteorological data were used as the model inputs. Based on the coefficient of determination (R2), root mean square error (RMSE), and Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (EF), the RBFNN and GEP models showed promising performance.

However, large uncertainties still exist in our estimates, mostly related to the uncertainties in upscaling in situ observations to large scale under non-stationary surface conditions. Here, we use machine learning models, artificial neural network and random forest informed by ground observations and atmospheric boundary layer theory, to retrieve consistent global long-term latent heat flux (ET in energy units) and sensible heat flux over recent decades. This study demonstrates that recent global land ET has increased significantly and that the main driver for the increased ET is increasing temperature. Moreover, the results suggest that the increasing ET is mostly in humid regions such as the tropics. These observation-driven findings are consistent with the idea that ET would increase with climate warming.

However, assuming the limitation of individual approaches, the integration of these two approaches has become a challenging task for ET simulation under varying surface and climatic conditions. To address this issue, a revised Penman-Monteith (PM) formula that uses a non-linear exponential Clausius-Clapeyron relationship was proposed in this study. The improved PM formula was further coupled into the loss function of the deep learning (DL) model, and subsequently, a hybrid DL model was formulated. The hybrid DL model with improved physical conceptualization considered the constraints of surface energy balance and turbulent diffusion processes in the ET simulation. The performance of the hybrid DL model was verified at 212 flux sites from the FLUXNET that contain ten types of underlying surfaces across the globe. The results revealed that as compared to the original DL model, the hybrid DL model improved the predictive capability of ET. The average root-mean-square-error (RMSE) and mean absolute percentage difference (MAPD) reduced by 12.1 W/m2 and 5.7%, respectively for latent heat flux (LE) simulation. Furthermore, the hybrid DL model also performed better than the original DL model in predicting the extreme events (such as ET under drought and heatwave conditions) which justifying its improved generalization capability. Sensitivity analysis outcomes showed that the vegetation parameters highest influence for ET simulations at the 212 flux sites, followed by soil parameters and meteorological parameters. The hybrid DL model was further applied to map the inter-seasonal distribution of global ET across twelve months of the year 2015 with five global ET products as the benchmark. Certainly, this research achieved the seamless integration of machine learning-based ET model and physical mechanism-based ET model and provided a new dimension for ET simulation. The hybrid DL model could be adopted to generate continuous ET datasets across regional and global scales. © 2021",Deep learning; Evapotranspiration; Hybrid deep learning model; Penman-Monteith method; Physical process description; Surface energy balance,Deep learning; Energy balance; Heat flux; Interfacial energy; Mean square error; Sensitivity analysis; Deep learning; Evapotranspiration models; Hybrid deep learning model; Learning models; Penman-Monteith formula; Penman-Monteith method; Physical process; Physical process description; Process descriptions; Surface energy balance; algorithm; energy balance; evapotranspiration; integrated approach; latent heat flux; sensitivity analysis; simulation; turbulent diffusion; Evapotranspiration,Yes,Yes,"weather station, empirical models","climate & meteorology, vegetation indices",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0

The most important factor in causing drought is rainfall, but increasing or decreasing the temperature and consequently, evapotranspiration can intensify or moderate the severity of drought events. Standardized Precipitation Evaporation Index (SPEI), as one of the most well-known indices in the definition of the drought situation, is applied based on potential precipitation, evapotranspiration, and the water balance. In this study, values of SPEI are formulated for various climates by three robust Artificial Intelligence (AI) models: Gene Expression Programming (GEP), Model Tree (MT), and Multivariate Adaptive Regression Spline (MARS). Meteorological variables including maximum temperature (Tmax), minimum temperature (Tmin), average temperature (Tmean), relative humidity (RH), 24-h rainfall (P24) and wind speed (U2) were used to perform the AI models.

Results of AI models development indicated that M5 version of MT provided the most accurate SPEI prediction for all the climatic situations in comparison with GEP and MARS techniques. SPEI values for four climatic conditions were evaluated in the reliability-based probabilistic framework to take into account the influence of any uncertainty and randomness associated with meteorological variables. In this way, the Monte-Carlo scenario sampling approach has been used to assess the limit state function from the AI models-based-SPEI. Based on the reliability analysis for all the synoptic stations, as the probability of exceedance values declined to below 75%, drought situations varied from “Normal” to “Very Extreme Humidity”. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.",Artificial intelligence models; Climate change; Drought index; Evaporation; Precipitation; Reliability analysis,artificial intelligence; climate change; climate conditions; drought; evaporation; precipitation (climatology); reliability analysis,Yes,Yes,weather station,"climate & meteorology, vegetation indices",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0

It has aroused widespread attention in related research communities due to its devastating impacts on agricultural production and natural systems. Based on a global reanalysis dataset, we identify flash droughts across China during 1979-2016 by focusing on the depletion rate of weekly soil moisture percentile. The relationship between the rate of intensification (RI) and nine related climate variables is constructed using three machine learning (ML) technologies, namely, multiple linear regression (MLR), long short-term memory (LSTM), and random forest (RF) models. On this basis, the capabilities of these algorithms in estimating RI and detecting droughts (flash droughts and traditional slowly evolving droughts) were analyzed. Results showed that the RF model achieved the highest skill in terms of RI estimation and flash drought identification among the three approaches. Spatially, the RF-based RI performed best in southeastern China, with an average CC of 0.90 and average RMSE of the 2.6 percentile per week, while poor performances were found in the Xinjiang region. For drought detection, all three ML technologies presented a better performance in monitoring flash droughts than in conventional slowly evolving droughts. Particularly, the probability of detection (POD), false alarm ratio (FAR), and critical success index (CSI) of flash drought derived from RF were 0.93, 0.15, and 0.80, respectively, indicating that RF technology is preferable in estimating the RI and monitoring flash droughts by considering multiple meteorological variable anomalies in adjacent weeks to drought onset. In terms of the meteorological driving mechanism of flash drought, the negative precipitation (P) anomalies and positive potential evapotranspiration (PET) anomalies exhibited a stronger synergistic effect on flash droughts compared to slowly developing droughts, along with asymmetrical compound influences in different regions of China. For the Xinjiang region, P deficit played a dominant role in triggering the onset of flash droughts, while in southwestern China, the lack of precipitation and enhanced evaporative demand almost contributed equally to the occurrence of flash drought. This study is valuable to enhance the understanding of flash droughts and highlight the potential of ML technologies in flash drought monitoring.  © 2022 Linqi Zhang et al.",,China; Agriculture; Climate models; Decision trees; Linear regression; Long short-term memory; Soil moisture; Agricultural production system; Condition; Energy; Machine learning technology; Machine-learning; Natural systems; Random forest modeling; Random forests; Research communities; Xinjiang regions; machine learning; Drought,Yes,Yes,weather station,"climate & meteorology, vegetation indices, soil",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0

The measurements were conducted by eddy-covariance systems and meteorological sensors in two similar screenhouse banana plantations during two consecutive seasons, 2016 and 2017. Most of the study focused on the season of 2017, which includes a more extended data set (141 days) than 2016 (52 days). The results show that in most cases, the ANN model was superior to MLR. When trained and validated over the whole data set of 2017, the ANN and MLR models provided R2 of 0.92 and 0.89, RMSE of 37.5 and 45.1 W m−2 and MAE of 21 and 27.2 W m−2, respectively. Models could be derived using a training dataset as short as one month and still provide reliable estimations. Depending on the chosen calendar month for training, R2 of the ANN model varied in the range 0.81–0.89, while for the MLR model, it ranged 0.73–0.88. When trained using a data set as short as one week, there was some deterioration in model performance; the corresponding ranges of R2 for the ANN and MLR models were 0.37–0.89 and 0.37–0.71, respectively. As expected for a screenhouse decoupled environment, solar radiation (Rg) was the variable that most influenced LE; using Rg as the sole input variable, the ANN model resulted in R2, RMSE and MAE of 0.88 and 47 W m−2 and 25.6 W m−2, respectively, values that are not much worse than using all input variables (solar radiation, air temperature, air relative humidity and wind speed). Using Rg alone as the input to the MLR model only slightly deteriorated R2 (=0.88); however, RMSE (=124 W m−2 ) and MAE (=75.7 W m−2 ) were significantly larger compared to a model based on all input variables. To examine model performance in different seasons, models were trained using the data set of 2017 and validated in 2016, and vice versa. Results showed that training on the data of 2017 and validation in 2016 provided superior results than the opposite, presumably since the 2017 measurement season was longer and weather conditions were more diverse than in the 2016 data set. It is concluded that the ANN and MLR models are reasonable options for estimating evapotranspiration in a banana screenhouse. © 2022 by the authors.

This study proposed a framework to separate the contribution of natural and anthropogenic factors to ET of human-managed land cover types using the Random Forest Regressor (RFR). The steps include: (1) classify land cover into natural and human-managed land covers and then divide ET, meteorological, topographical, and geographical data into two parts corresponding to natural and human-managed land cover types; (2) construct a natural ET (ETn) prediction model using natural land cover types of ET, and the corresponding meteorological, topographical and geographical factors; (3) the constructed ETn prediction model is used to predict the ETn of human-managed land cover types using the corresponding meteorological, topographical and geographical data as inputs, and (4) derive the anthropogenic ET (ETh) by subtracting the natural ET from the total ET (ETt) for human-managed land cover types. Take 2017 as an example, ETn and ETh for rainfed agriculture, mosaic agriculture, irrigated agriculture, and settlement in Colorado, Blue Nile, and Heihe Basin were separated by the proposed framework, with R2 and NSE of predicted ETn above 0.95 and RB within 1% for all three basins. In the semi-arid Colorado River Basin and arid Heihe Basin, human activities on human-managed land cover types tended to increase ET higher than humid Blue Nile Basin. The anthropogenic contribution to total water consumption is approaching 53.68%, 66.47%, and 6.14% for the four human-managed land cover types in Colorado River Basin, Heihe Bain and Blue Nile Basin, respectively. The framework provides strong support for the disturbance of water resources by different anthropogenic activities at the basin scale and the accurate estimation of the impact of human activities on ET to help achieve water-related sustainable development goals. © 2022",Anthropogenic ET; ET separation; Natural ET; Random Forest Regressor,Agriculture; Conservation of Natural Resources; Humans; Machine Learning; Rivers; Water Resources; China; Colorado; Gansu; Heihe Basin; Nile [Uganda]; Uganda; United States; Agriculture; Decision trees; Evapotranspiration; Forecasting; Machine learning; Sustainable development; Water conservation; Water supply; Watersheds; Anthropogenic contribution; Anthropogenic evapotranspiration; Anthropogenics; Blue Nile; Evapotranspiration separation; Land cover; Land-cover types; Natural evapotranspiration; Random forest regressor; Random forests; agriculture; anthropogenic source; conservation; evapotranspiration; human activity; land cover; machine learning; Sustainable Development Goal; water use; watershed; agricultural parameters; Article; conceptual framework; environmental management; environmental planning; environmental sustainability; evapotranspiration; geography; human activities; human impact (environment); land use; machine learning; meteorological phenomena; random forest; topography; water conservation; water supply; watershed; agriculture; environmental protection; human; machine learning; river; Separation,Yes,Yes,weather station,"climate & meteorology, vegetation indices",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0

In this study, the prediction of a novel monthly Combined Terrestrial Evapotranspiration Index (CTEI) was considered as a measure of all three types of drought (meteorology, hydrology, and agriculture) in the Ganga river basin (GRB) over the period of 14 years. For this purpose, a combination of hydro-meteorological and satellite-based data, including 11 input variables, was implemented. A new Artificial Neural Network (ANN) integrated with a Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA-ANN) and a Relief algorithm-based Feature Selection (FS) method was applied to simulate the monthly CTEI index and find the optimum input combinations. Besides, the standalone ANN and Least Square Support Vector Regression (LSSVR) models were examined to validate the WOA-ANN performance. The results indicated that WOA-ANN with (R = 0.9391), (RMSE = 0.241), (WI = 0.968), and (U95% = 0.669) had a high ability to predict CTEI and reduced the RMSE in the ANN and LSSVR models by 27% and 30%, respectively. WOA-ANN had the best predictive performance, followed by LSSVR and ANN models, respectively, concerning various graphical validations and diagnostic analyses. Besides, the outcome of this research, despite fewer parameters (seven parameters), considerably outperformed the study of (Elbeltagi et al., 2021) with (R = 0.9055 and RMSE = 0.33) accuracy employing 11 inputs. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",ANN; Drought; LSSVR; Relief algorithm; Terrestrial Evapotranspiration Index; Whale optimization algorithm,Ganges Basin; Agricultural products; Drought; Evapotranspiration; Feature extraction; Forecasting; Optimization; Features selection; Hybrid artificial intelligences; Index predictions; Least squares support vector regression; Optimization algorithms; Relief algorithm; Support vector regression models; Terrestrial evapotranspiration; Terrestrial evapotranspiration index; Whale optimization algorithm; algorithm; artificial intelligence; artificial neural network; potential evapotranspiration; prediction; satellite data; vector autoregression; Neural networks,Yes,Yes,"weather station, remote sensing","climate & meteorology, vegetation indices",0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0

To achieve optimum advantage from the land, proper exploitation of its resources is necessary. Remote sensing, advanced fuzzy logic, and multi-criteria decision-making like analytical hierarchy process (AHP) integrated agricultural land suitability analysis (ALAS) may facilitate identifying and formulating effective agricultural management strategies required for smart agriculture. OBJECTIVES: The present study was conducted to construct India's robust agricultural suitability model by developing hybrid fuzzy logic and the AHP based model. METHODS: Fourteen topographical, climatological, soil-related, land-use, and land-cover-related factors were prepared and employed to model agricultural suitability. Agricultural suitability models predicted multi-parameters based agricultural suitable zones for the entire country using three fuzzy operators (AND, Gamma 0.8, Gamma 0.9) and a hybrid fuzzy-AHP model. Sensitivity analysis was conducted to test the models' reliability using Moris technique-based global sensitivity analysis, random forest (RF), and correlation coefficient. The best agricultural suitable model was compared with the production of major crops in India. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Results showed that 19.8% of the study area was permanently not suitable in the northernmost region, 19.7% was currently not suitable in the northernmost region, while 20.1% and 20.2% areas were predicted as moderately suitable and highly suitable zones, respectively. The rainfall, elevation, slopes, evapotranspiration, and aridity index had a prime influence on the output of the agricultural suitability model. SIGNIFICANCE: The adopted method and its application processes can analyze agricultural land suitability and recommend optimal farming methods. It is also comprehended as a promising option for meeting food, nutrition, energy, and job demands while still protecting our threatened environment. © 2021",Agricultural suitability model; Analytical hierarchy process; Fuzzy logic; Machine learning algorithms; Remote sensing; Sensitivity analysis,India; analytical hierarchy process; fuzzy mathematics; GIS; land cover; land degradation; machine learning; mapping method; population growth; remote sensing; sensitivity analysis,Yes,Yes,remote sensing,climate & meteorology,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

For this purpose, firstly ETo data were estimated using meteorological data and the FAO Penman–Monteith (FAO-56 PM) method. Then, ETo modeling by six machine learning techniques including multiple linear regression (MLR), multiple non-linear regression (MNLR), multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), model tree M5 (M5), random forest (RF) and least-squares boost (LSBoost) was carried out. The technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) method was used under seven scenarios to rank models with evaluation and time criteria in the next step. After proving the acceptable performance of the LSBoost model, the downscaling of temperature (T) and precipitation (P) by the delta change factor (CF) method under three models ACCESS-ESM1-5, CanESM5 and MRI-ESM2-0 (scenarios SSP245-cov-fossil (SCF), SSP245-cov-modgreen (SCM) and SSP245-cov-strgreen (SCS)) was performed. The results showed that the monthly changes in the average T increases at all stations for all scenarios. Also, the average monthly change ratio of P increases in most stations and scenarios. In the next step, ETo forecasting under climate change for periods (2021–2050) was performed using the best model. Prediction results showed that ETo increases in all scenarios and stations in a pessimistic and optimistic state. In addition, the Monte Carlo method (MCM) showed that the lowest uncertainty is related to the Mianeh station in the MRI-ESM2-0 model and SCS scenario. © 2022 by the authors.

Therefore, accurate ETo information is critical to quantify crop water requirements for precision agriculture management. This study coupled bio-inspired optimization algorithms with artificial neural network (ANN), i.e., ANN with bat algorithm (BA-ANN), ANN with cuckoo search algorithm (CSA-ANN), and ANN with whale optimization algorithm (WOA-ANN), and developed three hybrid ANN models for daily ETo modeling with limited inputs. The models were trained and evaluated using a k-fold test approach and long-term daily climatic data from 2001 to 2018 at six climatic stations in the Loess Plateau of north China. Three input scenarios were used, including temperature-based inputs, radiation-based inputs, and mass transfer-based inputs. The statistical comparison showed that the hybrid WOA-ANN offered better estimates than BA-ANN and CSA-ANN in all three input scenarios. In general, the radiation-based WOA-ANN provided the most accurate ETo estimations, with regional average relative root mean square error and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient of 13.3% and 0.959, respectively. The temperature-based WOA-ANN offered acceptable and reasonable ETo estimates. Thus, it is a reliable tool for ETo modeling, given that air temperature is available in many regions. Overall, the bio-inspired optimization algorithms are robust tools for enhancing ANN performance in ETo simulation, and thus they are highly recommended to estimate ETo in the study region. Our study proposed powerful models for accurately estimating ETo with limited inputs, offering practical implications for the development of precision agriculture. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Agricultural water resources; Evapotranspiration; Machine learning; Precision agriculture; Whale optimization algorithm,China; Loess Plateau; Agricultural robots; Crops; Evapotranspiration; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Mass transfer; Mean square error; Optimization; Precision agriculture; Water management; Agricultural water; Agricultural water resource; Bio-inspired optimizations; Determinant factors; Evapotranspiration models; Optimization algorithms; Precision Agriculture; Reference crop evapotranspirations; Waters resources; Whale optimization algorithm; algorithm; artificial neural network; bioactivity; estimation method; evapotranspiration; optimization; Neural networks,Yes,Yes,Not Specified,"climate & meteorology, vegetation indices",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0

However, their true potential regarding pollination services and honey production is yet to be fully recognized. Worldwide, there are over 800 species of meliponine bees, with over 20 species documented on the African continent. Out of these, only 12 species have been well documented in Kenya. Moreover, interest on meliponine bees has increased amid climate change, agricultural intensification, and other anthropogenic effects. Generally, stingless bees are under-researched, with no previous documented evidence of their ecological niche (EN) distribution in most African countries. Hence, this study sought to establish the influence of bioclimatic, topographic, and vegetation phenology on their spatial distribution and change patterns. Stingless response variables from 490 sample points were collected and used in conjunction with 11 non-conflating features to build stingless ecological niche models. Six machine learning-based EN models were used to predict the distribution of seven stingless bees’ species combined. The results from the EN models showed that annual precipitation was the most influential variable to stingless bee distribution (contributing 43.09% logit), while potential evapotranspiration and temperature seasonality contributed 21.18% of the information needed to predict the spatial distribution of stingless bees. Vegetation phenology (21.36%) and topography (14.36%) had moderate effect on stingless bees’ distribution. On the other hand, high seasonality in precipitation and temperature indicated high stingless niche variability in the future (i.e. 2055). The performance of six EN algorithms used to predict distribution of stingless bees was found to be “excellent” for random forest (true skills statistics (TSS) = 0.91) and ranger (TSS = 0.90) and “good” for generalized additive models (TSS = 0.87), multivariate adaptive regression spline (TSS = 0.80), and boosted regression trees (TSS = 0.80), while they were “fair” for recursive portioning and regression trees (TSS = 0.79). These EN models could be utilized to inform stingless bee farming and insects pollinated crops by highlighting regions that provide highly suitable conditions for stingless bees. Additionally, the findings could be harnessed to increase both bee and agricultural productivity and forest conservation efforts through supplementary pollination services. © 2022 The Author(s).

Although deep neural networks (DNN) are powerful tools in the modelling of environmental phenomena, they are recognized as being challenging to interpret due to their black-box nature. To address this issue and understand the importance of each environmental control on dust pollution, game theory (i.e., Shapley values) was used to better understand the performance and interpretability of DNN models. Here, monthly mean values of precipitation, air temperature, surface wind speed, potential evapotranspiration, normalized difference vegetation index, normalized difference salinity index, Palmer drought severity index, soil heat flux, and surface pressure were selected as explanatory variables. The dust storm index (DSI), an indicator of dust pollution, was the predicted response variable for the cold and warm months. The results showed that the accuracies of the DNN model in predicting cold months DSI (CMDSI) and warm months DSI (WMDSI) were higher compared to other traditional machine learning algorithms. DNN model increased the R2 by 13% and 15% for predicting CMDSI and WMDSI, respectively, compared to the Random Forest model, which was the second most effective approach. According to the Shapley values, the most important controls on the occurrence of dust storms during the cold months of the study period (2000–2018) were wind speed, soil heat flux, and precipitation. During the warm months, wind speed was the most important controlling factor and was followed by precipitation, soil heat flux, and potential evapotranspiration. Overall, the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the DNN model and game theory in identifying the factors affecting dust pollution, which may help mitigate its impacts on the residents of western Iran. © 2021 The Author(s)",Air quality; Deep neural network; Dust events; Middle East; Remote sensing; Shapley values,Iran; Indicator indicator; Air quality; Cost functions; Data mining; Decision trees; Dust; Evapotranspiration; Forecasting; Random forests; Remote sensing; Storms; Wind; Controlling factors; Dust event; Dust pollution; Dust storm; Middle East; Neural network model; Remote-sensing; Shapley value; Soil heat flux; Western Iran; algorithm; data mining; dust; dust storm; environmental factor; game theory; livelihood; NDVI; pollution control; surface wind; Deep neural networks,Yes,Yes,Not Specified,"climate & meteorology, vegetation indices, soil",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0

While this could cause greater gross primary production (GPP) mainly contributed by the warm-season vegetation, the consequences for the dynamics of net ecosystem exchange (NEE) and hydrological responses (e.g., evapotranspiration, ET) on an ecosystem level are poorly known. Here, we in-vestigated the evolution of plant phenology, nutritive value, energy balance, and carbon/water budgets of a cool-season dominated pastoral ecosystem in the temperate zone; integrating both eddy covariance (EC) flux measurement and simulation modeling-based uncertainty analysis. Throughout the two-year duration (2017–2018) of this study, the entire pasture ecosystem remained a strong carbon sink (NEE = −1.23 and −1.95 kg C m−2, respectively) with 74% and 62% of available energy loss explained by EC fluxes, respectively. The cumulative ET was 735.8 and 796.8 mm, respectively; and the overall ecosystem water use efficiency (EWUE) were calculated as 6.5 g C kg−1 water across both growing seasons. The above-ground biomass yield agreed with the cumulative GPP and was inversely correlated with grass nutritive value. The uncertainty analysis indicated that accurate EC flux gap-filling models could be constructed using support vector machine trained time-series models (NEE, R2 = 0.77, RMSE = 11.8; ET, R2 = 0.90, RMSE = 73.8). The performance benchmarking tests indicated that REddyProc-based gap-filling performance was very limiting and highly variable (NEE, R2 = 0.21–0.64; ET, R2 = 0.79–0.87), particularly for estimating NEE. Overall, the warm-season vegetation encroachment greatly filled the production gap of cool-season grasses, leading to greater cumulative NEE and EWUE on a system level, compared with those from many other reported field-crop or grassland studies using EC approaches. The complex and dynamic nature of grassland ecosystems greatly challenged the conventional REddyProc-based EC flux gap-filling performance. However, accurate machine learning models could be constructed for error/uncertainty control purposes and, thus, should be encouraged in future studies. © 2021 by the authors.

Therefore, this study assessed different approaches to estimate ETo based on temperature and relative humidity, and temperature only across Brazil, as follows: (i) using the FAO56-PM equation with missing data estimated based on FAO56 methodologies; (ii) using the FAO56-PM equation with missing data estimated based on machine learning; and (iii) estimating ETo directly using machine learning. The FAO56-PM equation was also calibrated through linear regression and by calibrating the methodologies used to estimate missing data. The potential benefits of using multi-task learning (MTL) and clustering were also investigated. Data from 437 weather stations were used. Artificial neural network (ANN), random forest (RF), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) and multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) were employed. In both general and clustering scenarios, calibrating the FAO56-PM equation using linear regression provided slightly better results than calibrating the methodologies used to estimate missing data. In contrast to temperature- and relative humidity-based FAO56-PM equation, its temperature-based version performed better before both calibration types assessed. The machine learning models performed the best to estimate ETo and missing data. Combining the machine learning models with the FAO56-PM equation to estimate ETo performed similarly to using them individually. MTL and single-task learning (STL) provided similar results. In the general scenario, for the temperature-based models, using PM-ANN-STL increased mean NSE from 0.49 to 0.53 in relation to the non-calibrated FAO56-PM equation. For the temperature- and relative humidity-based models, using ANN and RF developed with STL or MTL increased NSE from 0.56 to 0.67 in relation to the FAO56-PM equation calibrated using linear regression. When using the clustering strategy, performance gains were obtained in estimating ETo with the temperature-based models, increasing mean NSE up to 0.58. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Generalizability; MARS; Neural networks; Solar radiation; Wind speed,Brazil; Adaptive boosting; Decision trees; Evapotranspiration; Linear regression; Linearization; Machine learning; Meteorology; Neural networks; Random forests; Generalizability; Meteorological data; Missing data; Multivariate adaptive regression splines; Neural-networks; Penman-Monteith equations; Reference evapotranspiration; Single task learning; Temperature and relative humidity; Wind speed; calibration; estimation method; evapotranspiration; machine learning; multivariate analysis; regression analysis; relative humidity; weather station; Wind,Yes,Yes,"weather station, empirical models","climate & meteorology, vegetation indices",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0

Small-scale experiments have demonstrated that the internal states of long short-term memory networks (LSTMs), a particular neural network architecture predisposed to hydrological modelling, can be interpreted. By extracting the tensors which represent the learned translation from inputs (precipitation, temperature, and potential evapotranspiration) to outputs (discharge), this research seeks to understand what information the LSTM captures about the hydrological system. We assess the hypothesis that the LSTM replicates real-world processes and that we can extract information about these processes from the internal states of the LSTM. We examine the cell-state vector, which represents the memory of the LSTM, and explore the ways in which the LSTM learns to reproduce stores of water, such as soil moisture and snow cover. We use a simple regression approach to map the LSTM state vector to our target stores (soil moisture and snow). Good correlations (R2>0.8) between the probe outputs and the target variables of interest provide evidence that the LSTM contains information that reflects known hydrological processes comparable with the concept of variable-capacity soil moisture stores. The implications of this study are threefold: (1) LSTMs reproduce known hydrological processes. (2) While conceptual models have theoretical assumptions embedded in the model a priori, the LSTM derives these from the data. These learned representations are interpretable by scientists. (3) LSTMs can be used to gain an estimate of intermediate stores of water such as soil moisture. While machine learning interpretability is still a nascent field and our approach reflects a simple technique for exploring what the model has learned, the results are robust to different initial conditions and to a variety of benchmarking experiments. We therefore argue that deep learning approaches can be used to advance our scientific goals as well as our predictive goals. © 2022 Thomas Lees et al.",,Brain; Learning systems; Memory architecture; Network architecture; Snow; Soil moisture; AS-soils; Concept formation; Effective rainfall; Extract informations; Hydrological process; Internal state; Memory network; Neural-networks; Simple++; State vector; hydrological phenomena; meteorology; rainfall-runoff modeling; river discharge; Long short-term memory,Yes,Yes,weather station,"climate & meteorology, vegetation indices, soil",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0

This suggests that GI is an important class of proteins. So far, the resource-intensive experimental methods have been mostly utilized for identification of GI proteins. Thus, we made an attempt in this study to develop a computational model for fast and accurate prediction of GI proteins. Ten different supervised learning algorithms i.e., SVM, RF, JRIP, J48, LMT, IBK, NB, PART, BAGG and LGB were employed for prediction, where the amino acid composition (AAC), FASGAI features and physico-chemical (PHYC) properties were used as numerical inputs for the learning algorithms. Higher accuracies i.e., 96.75% of AUC-ROC and 86.7% of AUC-PR were observed for SVM coupled with AAC + PHYC feature combination, while evaluated with five-fold cross validation. With leave-one-out cross validation, 97.29% of AUC-ROC and 87.89% of AUC-PR were respectively achieved. While the performance of the model was evaluated with an independent dataset of 18 GI sequences, 17 were observed as correctly predicted. We have also performed proteome-wide identification of GI proteins in wheat, followed by functional annotation using Gene Ontology terms.

The FAO-56 Penman–Monteith model has the highest accuracy in terms of ETo prediction, but its application is restricted by a lack of complete meteorological data. To develop a high accuracy prediction model for ETo with incomplete meteorological data, this study used four principal component analysis methods (i.e. path analysis, stepwise linear regression analysis, logistic regression analysis and factor analysis) to determine few factors that strongly affect ETo as the input to established the ETo model with machine learning (ML). The prediction model for ETo was established using support vector machine (SVM), gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT), particle swarm optimisation (PSO)- SVM, and PSO-GBDT algorithms. This study demonstrated that SVM, GBDT, PSO-SVM and PSO-GBDT models can maintain the highest accuracy by using the five most important affect factors extracted on the basis of path analysis (PA) as input, for various models, the precision ranges of NSE, R2, RMSE, MAE, and GPI were approximately 0.53–0.70, 0.63–0.84, 0.27–0.47, 0.27–0.69, and 0.72–1.01 respectively. The accuracy of SVM and GBDT significantly improved through optimisation using PSO. When inputting the top five factors of importance extracted by PA algorithm in each model, the SVM and GBDT model optimized by PSO algorithm increased the average value of GPI by 17.74% and 46.71% respectively. When inputting the top five factors extracted by the PA algorithm in PSO-GBDT, the average value of NSE, R2, RMSE and MAE is 22.37%, 2.83%, 9.05% and 6.84% higher than that of PSO-SVM, and the GPI is 8.30% higher than that of PSO-SVM. This study shows that the ETo prediction model constructed by the PSO-GBDT algorithm can obtain the highest accuracy when the top five factors extracted by the PA algorithm are used as input.

To attain sustainability in cropping systems, especially in semi-arid ecosystems, it is necessary to improve methodologies of ET estimation. A method to predict ET is by using land surface temperature (LST) from remote sensing data and applying the Operational Simplified Surface Energy Balance Model (SSEBop). However, to date, LST information from Landsat-8 Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) has a coarser resolution (100 m) and longer revisit time than Sentinel-2, which does not have a thermal infrared sensor, which compromises its use in ET models as SSEBop. Therefore, in the present study we set out to use Sentinel-2 data at a higher spatial-temporal resolution (10 m) to predict ET. Three models were trained using TIRS’ images as training data (100 m) and later used to predict LST at 10 m in the western section of the Copiapó Valley (Chile). The models were built on cubist (Cub) and random forest (RF) algorithms, and a sinusoidal model (Sin). The predicted LSTs were compared with three meteorological stations located in olives, vineyards, and pomegranate orchards. RMSE values for the prediction of LST at 10 m were 7.09 K, 3.91 K, and 3.4 K in Cub, RF, and Sin, respectively. ET estimation from LST in spatial-temporal relation showed that RF was the best overall performance (R2 = 0.710) when contrasted with Landsat, followed by the Sin model (R2 = 0.707). Nonetheless, the Sin model had the lowest RMSE (0.45 mm d−1 ) and showed the best performance at predicting orchards’ ET. In our discussion, we argue that a simplistic sinusoidal model built on NDVI presents advantages over RF and Cub, which are constrained to the spatial relation of predictors at different study areas. Our study shows how it is possible to downscale Landsat-8 TIRS’ images from 100 m to 10 m to predict ET. © 2021 by the authors.

This paper proposed a new workflow, namely ESVEP-RF, to calculate ET during the crop growing season using MODIS data by combining the advantages of the trapezoidal model and Random Forest (RF) algorithm. In ESVEP-RF, the endmember-based soil and vegetation energy partitioning (ESVEP) model was first used to calculate a series of parameters from MODIS and meteorological inputs, and then all parameters derived from remote sensing data, meteorological data and ESVEP models were used as inputs to the RF algorithm for latent heat flux (LE) calculation. In-situ data of 12 years (2003–2012, 2018 and 2019) from five flux towers located in Nebraska (NE) and Michigan (MI) were used to test the performance of ESVEP-RF, and results showed that ESVEP-RF had great potential to accurately calculate ET when the number of training samples was sufficient and representative. In 2010 and 2011, R2 of LE were around 0.8 and RMSE were around 70 W/m2, which outperformed original ESVEP model results. This indicated that the RF algorithm could better describe the non-linear correlation between in LST/FVC space endmembers and LE. Among all parameters, LAI, PLEv and R-vw had high contribution with percentage importance of 18.49%, 15.71% and 13.57%, respectively. Furthermore, all samples between 2003 and 2012 collected from the three NE sites were used to train RF models and then calculate LE for both NE and MI sites in 2018 and 2019. In NE sites, RMSE was around 65 W/m2 and R2 was around 0.8. In MI sites, it was noted that no samples from these sites were included in the training data set, and RMSE was around 70 W/m2 and R2 was higher than 0.7. These results showed the potential of ESVEP-RF for providing up-to-date ET information. © 2021",ESVEP; ET; Machine learning; Nebraska; Remote sensing,Michigan; Nebraska; United States; Crops; Cultivation; Decision trees; Evapotranspiration; Heat flux; Machine learning; Meteorology; Radiometers; Crop evapotranspiration; Crop growth; Endmember-based soil and vegetation energy partitioning; Endmembers; Energy partitioning; Michigan; Nebraska; Random forest algorithm; Random forests; Remote-sensing; evapotranspiration; growing season; growth rate; land surface; latent heat flux; MODIS; remote sensing; Remote sensing,Yes,Yes,"eddy covariance, weather station, remote sensing","climate & meteorology, vegetation indices",1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0

There is a need to move towards near real-time monitoring of land degradation using new sensors to detect degraded landscapes. Recently launched Sentinel-2 sensor presents the opportunity to collect high-resolution data regularly. Multi-temporal datasets provide crucial information to isolate evidence of land degradation from temporal changes in vegetation cover incurred as a result of climatic and phenological variability. This study applied an integrated approach involving multi-seasonal Sentinel-2 data with environmental variables (i.e. soil moisture, rainfall, slope, evapotranspiration, elevation, soil temperature, rainfall, soil temperature, aspect and albedo). A stratified random sampling approach based on dominant land cover types were used to assess land degradation. Field plots of 20 m × 20 m were setup with three 50 cm × 50 cm quadrants inside. In each quadrant, the percentage estimation of vegetation cover and Leaf Area Index was measured. The model training and validation was implemented using the Random Forest algorithm based on default parameters. The pooled model represents the dry and wet seasons combined. Results showed that pooled model had higher accuracies for Photosynthetic vegetation (PV) (R2 of 0.89, RMSE-11.46%, relRMSE-8.7%), Non-Photosynthetic Vegetation (NPV) (R2 of 0.93, RMSE-5.64%, relRMSE% 17.72) and Bare Soil (BS) (R2 of 0.92, RMSE 8.7% and relRMSE 11.46%).

ETo modelling based on a single meteorological parameter would be beneficial in places where the collection of climatic parameters is challenging. The aim of this research is to develop a deep neural network (DNN) architecture that predicts daily ETo with a single input parameter selected based on the feature importance (FI) score generated by the machine learning techniques, random forest (RF), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost). This study also investigated the potential of SHapley Additive exPlanations to interpret and validate the outcomes of the feature selection methods by assessing the contributions of each feature to the ETo prediction. These methods recommended solar radiation as a significant parameter in the datasets of three California Irrigation Management System (CIMIS) weather stations located in distinct ETo zones. Three ETo models (DNN-Ret, XGB-Ret, and RF-Ret) were built using solar radiation as the sole input, and CIMIS ETo as the output. The performance evaluation of the developed models proved that DNN-Ret outperformed XGB-Ret and RF-Ret regardless of the dataset, with coefficients of determination (R2) ranging from 0.914 to 0.954 in the local scenario, with an average decrease of 8–9.5% in mean absolute error and root mean squared error, and an improvement of 2.6–2.9% in Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency and 1.7–2% increase in R2.

However, the new hybrid HA techniques, namely Moth-Flame Optimization Algorithm (MFO) and Water Cycle Optimization Algorithm (WCA) are rarely applied to estimate ETo in the earlier literature. Therefore, this study assessed prediction and the estimation abilities of a novel hybrid adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS-WCAMFO) for monthly ETo of Dhaka and Mymensing stations with data-limited humid regions of south-central Bangladesh. Prediction precision of the ANFIS-WCAMFO model is compared with other state-of-art models, i.e., ANFIS-WCA and ANFIS-MFO using a 4-fold cross-validation method including root-mean-square-error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), and coefficient of determination (R2). Nine input combinations of meteorological datasets, including extraterrestrial radiation (Ra), solar radiation (Rs), maximum and minimum temperatures (Tmax and Tmin), relative humidity (RH), and wind speed (U2), were employed for model training and testing purposes. The ANFIS-WCAMFO performed superior to the other state-of-arts methods in estimating monthly ETo in all input combinations. The ANFIS-WCA, ANFIS-MFO, and ANFIS-WCAMFO hybrid models for estimating ETo improved RMSE as 2.7%, 6.9%, and 15.1% for Dhaka station and 0.6%, 7.3%, 12.4% for Mymensingh station, respectively. The use of the Ra variable with the temperature inputs considerably improved the models’ accuracy in ETo; improvements in RMSE, MAE, NSE, and R2 of the hybrid ANFIS-WCMFO models were 26.6%, 30.9%, 17.6%, and 8.2% for Dhaka station and by 28.8%, 34.2%, 18.8% and 22.1% for Mymensingh station, respectively.

This study aimed to investigate the spatiotemporal variations in ET0 in China and to improve the accuracy of ET0 calculations on different spatiotemporal scales. Meteorological data collected at 100 stations in China during 1961 to 2019 were used to calculate ET0 with the Penman–Monteith model, and the temporal and spatial patterns in ET0-PM were analyzed with the Mann–Kendall nonparametric trend test method. Three machine learning models comprising convolutional neural network (CNN), extreme learning machine (ELM), and multiple adaptive regression splines (MARS), and seven empirical models calibrated with mind evolutionary algorithm (MEA) were compared to assess their suitability for calculating ET0 on different spatiotemporal scales in China. The results showed that the annual mean ET0-PM value (413.29–2772.35 mm) in China gradually increased from north to south and from west to east. ET0 exhibited an upward trend in the temperate continental zone (TCZ) and mountain plateau zone (MPZ) but a downward trend in the temperate monsoon zone (TMZ) and subtropical monsoon region (SMZ). By comparing the global performance indicators (GPI), the machine learning models generally performed better than the empirical models at different spatiotemporal scales. And CNN was the best model for calculating ET0 in terms of the model accuracy and stability. On the daily scale, MARS performed well in MPZ, whereas ELM performed well in TMZ and TCZ. On the monthly scale, MARS performed well in TMZ, whereas ELM performed well in SMZ and MPZ.

The hybrid ET model that combines the physical framework, namely the Penman-Monteith equation and machine learning (ML) algorithms, have proven to be effective in ET estimates. However, few studies compared the performances in estimating ET between multiple hybrid model versions using different ML algorithms. In this study, we constructed six different hybrid ET models based on six classical ML algorithms, namely the K nearest neighbor algorithm, random forest, support vector machine, extreme gradient boosting algorithm, artificial neural network (ANN) and long short-term memory (LSTM), using observed data of 17 eddy covariance flux sites of cropland over the globe. Each hybrid model was assessed to estimate ET with ten different input data combinations. In each hybrid model, the ML algorithm was used to model the stomatal conductance (Gs), and then ET was estimated using the Penman-Monteith equation, along with the ML-based Gs. The results showed that all hybrid models can reasonably reproduce ET of cropland with the models using two or more remote sensing (RS) factors. The results also showed that although including RS factors can remarkably contribute to improving ET estimates, hybrid models except for LSTM using three or more RS factors were only marginally better than those using two RS factors. We also evidenced that the ANN-based model exhibits the optimal performance among all ML-based models in modeling daily ET, as indicated by the lower root-mean-square error (RMSE, 18.67–21.23 W m−2) and higher correlations coefficient (r, 0.90–0.94). ANN are more suitable for modeling Gs as compared to other ML algorithms under investigation, being able to provide methodological support for accurate estimation of cropland ET on a regional scale. © 2021 by the authors.

Evaluation of crop yield has an important role in agricultural policy making due to different conditions and restrictions. Estimating rice yield is a key factor in food security. Any change in the effective parameters can cause changes in rice yield and therefore the food security of the population will be affected. In this study, rice crop yield was estimated by artificial neural networks (ANNs) and ANN-genetic programming (GP) in 2011 and 2015. Rainfall, permeability, soil texture, land type, evapotranspiration and inlet and inflow and outflow water to paddy lands were used as inputs. The results showed that the ANN-GP with a root mean square error (RMSE = 80.8 kg ha‾¹) and a correlation coefficient (CC = 0.91) was more accurate than the stand-alone ANN (with RMSE = 139 kg ha‾¹ and CC = 0.67).

Evapotranspiration (ET) is a crucial component of urban greening initiatives of cities worldwide aimed at mitigating these issues. However, ET estimation methods in urban areas have so far been limited. An expanding number of flux towers in urban environments provide the opportunity to directly measure ET by the eddy covariance method. In this study, we present a novel approach to model urban ET by combining flux footprint modeling, remote sensing and geographic information system (GIS) data, and deep learning and machine learning techniques. This approach facilitates spatio-temporal extrapolation of ET at a half-hourly resolution; we tested this approach with a two-year dataset from two flux towers in Berlin, Germany. The benefit of integrating remote sensing and GIS data into models was investigated by testing four predictor scenarios. Two algorithms (1D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and random forest (RF)) were compared. The best-performing models were then used to model ET values for the year 2019. The inclusion of GIS data extracted using flux footprints enhanced the predictive accuracy of models, particularly when meteorological data was more limited. The best-performing scenario (meteorological and GIS data) showed an RMSE of 0.0239 mm/h and R2 of 0.840 with RF and an RMSE of 0.0250 mm/h and a R2 of 0.824 with 1D CNN for the more vegetated site. The 2019 ET sum was substantially higher at the site surrounded by more urban greenery (366 mm) than at the inner-city site (223 mm), demonstrating the substantial influence of vegetation on the urban water cycle.

Every year floods have a deleterious effect on people, agriculture and infrastructure. Due to its high population density and poor infrastructure, the damage caused by floods in India is exacerbated forcing millions of people to migrate from one place to other. Therefore, there is a need to devise flood mitigation strategies that would forecast future floods in real time. In this paper, machine learning techniques have been used for forecasting floods in the northern districts of Bihar. Experimental results showed that, in addition to traditional meteorological parameters rainfall and temperature, certain parameters like vapour pressure, cloud cover, wet day frequency, crop evapo-transpiration and surface evapo-transpiration had a severe impact on the performance of a flood forecasting model.

However, one major problem is the reliability of physical sensors’ nodes, which creates difficulty in a real-time system to identify whether the physical sensor is transmitting correct values or malfunctioning due to external disturbances affecting the system, such as noise. In this paper, the use of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based neural networks is proposed as an alternate approach to address this problem. The proposed solution is tested for a smart irrigation system, where a physical sensor is replaced by a neural sensor. The Smart Irrigation System (SIS) contains several physical sensors, which transmit temperature, humidity, and soil moisture data to calculate the transpiration in a particular field. The real-world values are taken from an agriculture field, located in a field of lemons near the Ghadap Sindh province of Pakistan. The LM35 sensor is used for temperature, DHT-22 for humidity, and we designed a customized sensor in our lab for the acquisition of moisture values. The results of the experiment show that the proposed deep learning-based neural sensor predicts the real-time values with high accuracy, especially the temperature values. The humidity and moisture values are also in an acceptable range. Our results highlight the possibility of using a neural network, referred to as a neural sensor here, to complement the functioning of a physical sensor deployed in an agriculture field in order to make smart irrigation systems more reliable. © 2022 by the authors.

Although the FAO Penman–Monteith model is the highly recommended for estimating ET0, its requirement of a complete climatic variables has made the application of this model complicated. The objective of this study was to investigate the potential of four machine learning (ML) models, namely extreme learning machine (ELM), genetic programming (GP), random forest (RF), and support vector regression (SVR), for estimating daily ET0 with limited climatic data using a tenfold cross-validation method across different climate zones in New Mexico. Four input scenarios, namely S1 (Tmax (maximum air temperature), Tmin (minimum air temperature), RHave (average relative humidity), U2 (wind speed at 2 m height), RS (total solar radiation)), S2 (Tmax, Tmin, U2, RS), S3 (Tmax, Tmin, RS), and S4 (Tave, RS), were considered using climatic data during the 2009–2019 period from six selected weather stations across different climate zones. The results showed that the estimated daily ET0 differed significantly following ML model types and input scenarios across different climate zones. The ML models under S1 scenario showed the best estimation accuracy during the testing stage in climate zones 1 and 5 (RMSE and MAE < 0.5 mm day−1). The ML models under S3 and S4 scenarios were found to be more preferred at climate zones 1, 5, and 8 (RMSE and MAE < 1 mm day−1). The estimation accuracy of ML models was decreased with lack of RHave and U2 data in input scenarios although the ML models based on S4 scenario (only Tave and RS) showed acceptable ET0 estimations particularly in the climate zone 5 (0.5 mm day−1 < RMSE < 0.6 mm day−1). The SVR and ELM were the best ML models for all input scenarios in the studied climate zones where these models showed the best stabilities in the testing stages. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.",,New Mexico; United States; accuracy assessment; air temperature; estimation method; evapotranspiration; machine learning; relative humidity,Yes,Yes,"weather station, empirical models",climate & meteorology,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

There exist different ways, including physical-based and data-driven approaches, to estimate evapotranspiration. Here, the physical-based model (the surface energy balance system, SEBS), data-driven models (using three machine learning techniques, deep neural network (DNN), random forest (RF), and symbolic regression (SR)), and hybrid model were compared using the FLUXNET2015 dataset. More importantly, different search strategies were investigated to optimize the network architecture and to explore the maximum accuracy of data-driven models. The Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) was introduced to quantify the contributions of input features to evapotranspiration estimation. The results show that there is a large error in the SEBS model with RMSE of 121 W m−2, while the data-driven models acquire the best evapotranspiration estimation with RMSE of 32–53 W m−2. The hybrid approach, whose RMSE is 60 W m−2, improves the SEBS model but still underperforms data-driven models. The complexity of data-driven models influences the accuracy of evapotranspiration estimations. By optimizing the network architecture, DNN and RF obtain results with similar precision. But the performance of SR, which generates a simple algebraic formula for evapotranspiration estimation, is significantly degraded. SHAP reveals that all models regard net radiation as the most crucial feature. The SEBS and hybrid models attach much importance to temperature and humidity. Three data-driven models learn the different relationships between input features and evapotranspiration. The DNN-based model is likely to learn a relatively correct relationship among the data-driven models because it has a similar feature importances pattern with physical-based and hybrid models. © 2021",Data-driven; Evapotranspiration; Hybrid modeling; Physical-based,Decision trees; Evapotranspiration; Network architecture; Data driven; Data driven modelling; Hybrid modelling; Neural-networks; Physical based modeling; Physical-based; Random forests; Surface energy balance systems; Symbolic regression; Systems modelling; accuracy assessment; comparative study; energy balance; estimation method; evapotranspiration; machine learning; numerical model; physical analysis; Deep neural networks,Yes,Yes,Not Specified,climate & meteorology,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

When a weather station experiences a mechanical or communications failure, a replacement (imputed) value should be substituted for any missing data. This study introduces a machine learning, network-based approach to imputing missing 15-minute and daily maximum/minimum air temperature observations from 8.5 years of air temperature, relative humidity, wind, and solar radiation observations at 134 AgWeatherNet (AWN) stations in Washington State. A random forest imputation model trained on temperature and humidity observations from the full network predicted 15-minute, daily maximum, and daily minimum temperature values with mean absolute errors of 0.43 °C, 0.53 °C, and 0.70 °C, respectively. Sensitivity experiments determined that imputation skill was related a number of external factors including volume and type of training data, proximity of surrounding stations, and regional topography. In particular, nocturnal cold air flows in the upper Yakima Valley of south-central Washington caused temperature to be less correlated with surrounding stations in the overnight hours. In a separate experiment, the imputation model was used to predict base- 10 °C GDD on 2020 July 1 trained entirely on 15-minute station data from previous years. Even with the entire season of observations missing, the model predicted the GDD value within an average error 1.4% with 125 of 134 stations within 5% of observations. Since missing data can typically be resolved within a timeframe of a few days, the network-based imputation model is a sufficient substitute for short periods of missing observational weather data. Other potential applications of an imputation model are briefly discussed. © 2021",Big data; Degree day models; Machine learning; Missing data imputation; Surface weather observations,Washington; Big data; Decision trees; Machine learning; Meteorology; Random errors; Topography; Weather forecasting; Air temperature; Decisions makings; Degree-day model; Growing degree-days; Missing data; Missing data imputations; Model-based OPC; Surface weather observations; Temperature observations; Weather data; air temperature; evapotranspiration; humidity; machine learning; solar radiation; topography; weather station; Atmospheric temperature,Yes,Yes,weather station,"climate & meteorology, vegetation indices",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0

However, less attention has been given to future predictions of ET at watershed-scales especially since with a changing climate, there are additional challenges to planning and management of water resources. In this paper, we used nine years of total seasonal ET derived using a satellite-based remote sensing model, Mapping Evapotranspiration at Internalized Calibration (METRIC), to develop a Random Forest machine learning model to predict watershed-scale ET into the future. This statistical model used topographic and climate variables in agricultural areas of Lower Yakima, Washington and had a prediction accuracy of 88% for the region. This model was then used to predict ET into the future with changed climatic conditions under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 emission scenarios expected by 2050s. The model result shows increases in seasonal ET across some areas of the watershed while decreases in other areas. On average, growing seasonal ET across the watershed was estimated to increase by +5.69% under the low emission scenario (RCP4.5) and +6.95% under the high emission scenario (RCP8.5). © 2021 by the authors.

In this study, four machine learning (ML) models, including random tree (RT), random forest (RF), additive regression (AR) and reduced error pruning tree (REPT) were used to model blue and green water footprint (BWFP and GWFP) for the present and future stages in the Yunnan Province, southwest China. Climate variables of daily precipitation, temperature, solar radiation, sunshine hours, wind speed, relative humidity and vapor pressure deficit data, yield and sown areas of rice were collected form 16 districts from 1990 to 2018. Six different scenarios (Sc1-Sc6) with different combinations of climate variables, crop coefficient and sown areas were used as inputs of the ML models for each of blue and green water footprint. Also, future climate projections of maximum (Tmax) and minimum (Tmin) temperatures, precipitation and sunshine were adopted for two different emission scenarios, RCP 4.5 and 8.5 from 2021to 2050, based on Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL-ESM2M) model. For BWFP, the RT model in Sc1 with inputs of solar radiation, humidity, and vapor pressure deficit, was superior to the other scenarios with root mean square error (RMSE) and mean average percentage error (MAPE) values of 11.82 (m3 ton-1) and 0.5%, respectively. Sc4 (sown area, Tmin, sunshine hours) and Sc5 (sown area, Tmin, Tmax, crop coefficient) were the best two scenarios for all models applied for BWFP, while addition of precipitation to these two scenarios were the best for GWFP. Further, GWFP was highly negative anomaly in 2011 by 46%, 34% and 32% for the districts 5, 1 and 2 respectively, followed by 2010. Predictions of variable trends in the future showed that crop evapotranspiration during the growing season would increase in all the districts, although effective precipitation (Peff) would have both decreasing and increasing trends. Furthermore, BWFP and GWFP will have an upward trend in the future based on RCP4.5 in Sc4.

This study compares six different models with sequential inclusion of six meteorological input variables such as minimum temperature (Tmin), maximum temperature (Tmax), mean relative humidity (RH), wind speed (SW), sunshine hours (HSS), and solar radiation (RS), which are necessarily used in physical or empirical-based models to estimate ET0. Each model utilized three variants of machine learning algorithms, i.e. Additive Regression (AdR), Random Subspace (RSS), M5 Pruning tree (M5P) independently and four novel permutated hybrid combinations of these algorithms. To evaluate the efficacy of these hybridizations and the stability of machine learning models, a comprehensive evaluation of independent and hybrid models was performed. With more input variables, the model performances were found to be superior in terms of prediction accuracies. The model AdR6 that included all the 6 selected meteorological variables outperformed other models during the testing period, exhibiting statistical performance of MAPE (1.30), RMSE (0.07), RAE (2.41), RRSE (3.10), and R 2 (0.998). However, the AdR algorithm, alone, was found to capture about 86% of variance in the observed data conforming to the 95% confidence band across all models irrespective of the number of input variables used to predict ET0. The RSS algorithm, in comparison to other algorithms, failed to capture the observed trends even with all the input variables. The hybrid combinations of algorithms with AdR as a constituent were better performers in terms of their prediction accuracies but remained inferior to AdR as an individual performer. All the algorithms are better predictors of the higher values of ET0 that included values beyond the 75% quartile. © 2022 Environment and Climate Change Canada.

Accurate estimation of ET based on data-driven methods is of great theoretical and practical significance for exploring soil evaporation, plant transpiration and the regional hydrological balance. Most existing estimation approaches were proposed based on multiple meteorological variables. This study proposed a novel hybrid estimation approach to estimate the monthly ET using only historical ET time series in the southeastern margins of the Tengger Desert, China. The approach consisted of three sections including data preprocessing, parameter optimization and estimation. The model evaluation demonstrated that the hybrid model based on the variational mode decomposition (VMD) method, grey wolf optimizer (GWO) algorithm and support vector machine (SVM) model achieved superior computational performance compared to the performance of other methods. The Nash–Sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency (NSCE) increased from 0.8588 to 0.8754 and the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) decreased from 28.42% to 23.22% in the testing stage. Thus, we suggest that the hybrid VMD-GWO-SVM model will be the best choice for estimating ET in the absence of regional meteorological monitoring. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Evapotranspiration; Grey wolf optimizer algorithm; Support vector machine; Tengger Desert; Variational mode decomposition,China; Tengger Desert; Evapotranspiration; Transpiration; Estimation approaches; Gray wolf optimizer algorithm; Gray wolves; Integrated method; Mode decomposition; Optimizers; Support vector machine models; Support vectors machine; Tengger desert; Variational mode decomposition; algorithm; evapotranspiration; integrated approach; machine learning; monitoring; support vector machine; Support vector machines,Yes,Yes,weather station,"climate & meteorology, vegetation indices, soil",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0

Traditionally, in-situ methods such as measurements of leaf water potential (ΨL) or soil moisture have been used for estimating plant water stress in vineyards. However, these methods are time, labor, and cost-intensive, and limited to point measurements of water stress that do not offer much spatial resolution. In this study, hyperspectral images acquired from a ground-based utility vehicle were analyzed to evaluate the applicability of hyperspectral data in classifying plant water stress measured as ΨL into three classes: no to mild water stress (ΨL > -0.8 MPa), moderate water stress (-0.8 MPa ≤ ΨL ≤ -1.2 MPa) and severe water stress (ΨL < -1.2 MPa). A field trial was carried out in an experimental vineyard in arid southeastern Washington, USA. Grapevines were subjected to either full irrigation (FI) or regulated deficit irrigation (RDI). Several vegetative indices (VIs) derived from hyperspectral reflectance information were assessed to estimate the level of water stress. Linear relationships between VIs and ΨL, and relative variable importance based on Gini impurity in different test models were evaluated to select optimal VIs for vine water stress classification. Green Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (GNDVI), Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI), and Anthocyanin Index (ANT) showed consistently good trends in the data obtained over two growing seasons and were selected as the optimal VIs. In addition, air relative humidity, evapotranspiration, minimum soil temperature, and solar radiation demonstrated high significance in model development and were included in the final optimized random forest classifier (RFC) and artificial neural network (ANN) models. The RFC model had an accuracy of 73% while the ANN model had an accuracy of 70% in classifying plant water condition into three classes. Both models demonstrated good classification abilities and can be applied to analyze vine water stress and developing decision support tools for precision irrigation in vineyards. © 2022 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.",Artificial neural network; Deficit irrigation; Leaf water potential; Machine learning; Random forest classifier; Spatial variability; Vegetation Index; Vineyard; Water stress,United States; Washington [United States]; Decision support systems; Decision trees; Hyperspectral imaging; Irrigation; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Neural networks; Reflection; Soil moisture; Spectroscopy; Vegetation mapping; Deficit irrigation; Leaf water potential; Machine-learning; Measurements of; Random forest classifier; Spatial variability; Vegetation index; Vegetative index; Vineyard; Water stress; algorithm; machine learning; multispectral image; vineyard; water stress; Soil temperature,Yes,Yes,"remote sensing, field measurement","climate & meteorology, vegetation indices, soil, plant physiology",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1

These models ignore the variations inVm25over time and space, resulting in substantial errors in regional estimates of cropland GPP. Thus, to resolve this problem, we used the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) to assimilate tower-based GPP from five maize flux sites into a process-based mode to obtain the 'apparent' value ofVm25and then modeled this parameter using machine learning (ML) algorithms. The results showed thatVm25increased during the early growing season and then decreased after reaching a peak value in the middle of the growing season. The coefficient of determination (R2) root mean square error (RMSE) for satellite-driven coupled photosynthesis and evapotranspiration simulator (SCOPES)-Crop with EnKF-derived variedVm25in simulating daily GPP across all site-days increased (decreased) by 0.17 (5.63 μ m-2 s-1) on average compared to that for the model with fixed Vm25. We used four ML algorithms, namely artificial neural network, random forest, extreme gradient enhancement, and convolutional neural network (CNN), to model theVm25of maize. The CNN algorithm yielded the best results. The average of the R2 (RMSE) values of simulated GPP using CNN-basedVm25over the three flux sites is 0.93 (1.95 μmol m-2 s-1), higher (smaller) than that using fixed Vm25. This study implies that representing the seasonal variations inVm25can facilitate improved estimates of GPP and the ML methods are useful tools for modeling the variation in Vm25.  © 1980-2012 IEEE.",Ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF); gross primary productivity (GPP); machine learning (ML); maximum carboxylation rate at 25 Â°C; process-based model,Carboxylation; Chlorophyll; Crops; Decision trees; Ecosystems; Estimation; Kalman filters; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Mean square error; Neural networks; Photosynthesis; Phytoplankton; Vegetation mapping; Biological system modeling; Ensemble Kalman Filter; Gross primary productivity; Index; Machine learning algorithms; Machine-learning; Maximum carboxylation rate at 25 °C; Process-based modeling; Remote-sensing; Vegetation mapping; algorithm; estimation method; machine learning; numerical model; primary production; simulation; Remote sensing,Yes,Yes,remote sensing,"climate & meteorology, plant physiology",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1

To overcome this difficulty, we used artificial neural networks to estimate crack characteristics in a Vertisol under field conditions. From July 2019 to June 2020, the morphometric characteristics of soil cracks (area, depth and volume), and environmental factors (soil moisture, rainfall, potential evapotranspiration and water balance) were monitored and evaluated in six experimental plots in a tropical semiarid region. Sixty-six events were measured in each plot to calibrate and validate two sets of inputs in the multilayer neural network model. One set was comprised of environmental factors with significant correlations with the morphometric characteristics of cracks in the soil. The other included only those with a significant high and very high correlation, reducing the number of variables by 35%. The set with the significant high and very high correlations showed greater accuracy in predicting crack characteristics, implying that it is preferable to have fewer variables with a higher correlation than to have more variables of lower correlation in the model. Both sets of data showed a good performance in predicting area and depth of cracks in the soils with a clay content above 30%. The highest dispersion of modeled over predicted values for all morphometric characteristics was in soils with a sand content above 40%. The model was successful in evaluating crack characteristics from environmental factors within its limitations and may support decisions on watershed management in view of climate-change scenarios. © 2022 by the authors.

This study for the first time evaluated the forecasting performances of 16 d ahead daily weather variables and subsequent ET0 at 51 weather stations across various climatic zones of China using the Global Ensemble Reforecast v2 Data provided by the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Global Ensemble Forecast System (GEFS) model. Particularly, a novel machine learning model, i.e., extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), was proposed to downscale and bias correct the GEFS forecasts. The results showed that the GEFS forecasts downscaled by the XGBoost model were more accurate than those downscaled by the inverse distance weighting (IDW) and equidistant cumulative distribution functions matching (EDCDFm) methods, with decreases in mean RMSE of maximum temperature (Tmax), minimum temperature (Tmin), relative humidity (RH), wind speed (Ws) and solar radiation (Rs) by 36.2%, 33.5%, 35.7%, 75.0% and 27.0%, and by 11.2%, 13.3%, 14.0%, 26.4% and 13.2%, resulting in decreases in mean RMSE of ET0 by 35.0% and 18.2%, respectively. The overall forecasting performance of Tmin (NRMSE = 0.14–0.27, R2 = 0.82–0.95) was best, followed by Tmax (NRMSE = 0.11–0.26, R2 = 0.74–0.94), Rs (NRMSE = 0.23–0.41, R2 = 0.34–0.77), RH (NRMSE = 0.18–0.26, R2 = 0.27–0.72) and finally Ws (NRMSE = 0.34–0.46, R2 = 0.22–0.58), and their forecasting performances decreased with the increase in lead time. Nationally averaged RMSE values of daily ET0 for 16 d lead time (1.0 mm d−1) and 8 d lead time (0.9 mm d−1) were approximately 1.7 and 1.5 times of that for 1 d lead time (0.6 mm d−1), respectively. Average R2 values of ET0 across China varied 0.56–0.85 for 1–16 d lead times, while the corresponding NRMSE values ranged 0.22–0.38, with more accurate ET0 estimates in the temperate continental zone (TCZ) and mountain plateau zone (MPZ) than the temperate monsoon zone (TMZ) and (sub)tropical monsoon zone (SMZ). The forecasting performance of seasonal ET0 was generally better in summer, followed by autumn, spring and winter. The greatest reduction in the forecasting performance of daily ET0 was produced by the forecasting error of Rs in all climatic zones, followed by Ws, Tmax and RH in TCZ and MPZ, and by RH, Ws and Tmax in TMZ and SMZ; however, the influence of Tmin was marginal in all climatic zones. The results indicated that daily ET0 across China can be satisfactorily forecasted using the GEFS outputs downscaled by the XGBoost model, particularly for 1–8 d lead times. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Forecasting; Lead time; Numerical weather prediction; Reference evapotranspiration; XGBoost model,China; Adaptive boosting; Decision making; Distribution functions; Evapotranspiration; Inverse problems; Learning systems; Wind; Climatic zone; Ensemble forecast systems; Forecasting performance; Gradient boosting; Leadtime; Medium range; Numerical weather prediction; Reference evapotranspiration; Tropical monsoon; Xgboost model; drought; evapotranspiration; extreme event; forecasting method; monsoon; temperature effect; weather forecasting; Weather forecasting,Yes,Yes,weather station,"climate & meteorology, vegetation indices",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0

Taking the grassland ecosystem in arid and semi-arid regions of Northern China (ASNC) as an example, we proposed a framework for estimating ET at weather stations without flux observations through a machine learning approach by combining data from MODIS and fifteen flux towers distributed in alpine grassland (AG) and temperate grassland (TG) across ASNC. First, we analyzed the temporal characteristics of grassland ET at site scale. Second, we applied the machine learning approach Random Forest (RF) to develop a robust model for simulating site-scale grassland ET, and used random and spatial cross-validations (CVs) and three metrics to evaluate the RF models performance. Two strategies (using pooled data from all flux towers for a general model, and dividing data by grassland type to develop models specific to AG and TG) and four temporal resolutions (daily, 8-day, monthly and seasonal) were used to develop the RF models. Third, we investigated how the importance of predictor variables for estimating grassland ET changed in different CVs, strategies and temporal resolutions. The ET of AG and TG showed similar dynamic patterns but differed in magnitude. The RF models showed good performance in both strategies and all four temporal resolutions (R2 > 0.64, MAE < 0.53 mm d−1, RMSE < 0.72 mm d−1). However, seasonal ET simulations performed better than that of daily, 8-day and monthly using pooled data from all flux towers, especially in spatial CV. Meteorological variables (temperature, precipitation and radiation), vegetation (NDVI, LAI and FPAR) and soil (soil water content and soil temperature) were strong predictors of variation in grassland ET. Changes in the importance ranking and value of predictor variables partly explained the variations of model performance. The robust model performance in spatial CV proved that the framework developed in this study was reliable when applied to weather stations without flux observations, thereby overcoming the scarcity of site-scale actual ET measurements. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Evapotranspiration; Grasslands; Machine learning; Multiple temporal resolutions; Spatial cross-validation; Weather stations without flux observations,China; Ecosystems; Forestry; Machine learning; Radiometers; Soil moisture; Towers; Vegetation; Weather information services; Actual evapotranspiration; Flux observation; Flux towers; Grassland; Machine-learning; Multiple temporal resolution; Spatial cross validations; Temporal resolution; Weather station without flux observation; Weather stations; evapotranspiration; grassland; leaf area index; machine learning; model validation; MODIS; NDVI; observational method; Evapotranspiration,Yes,Yes,"eddy covariance, weather station, remote sensing","climate & meteorology, vegetation indices, soil",1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0

Light intensity and CO2 concentration are among the most important determinants of growth and WP of crops. In this study, the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) was used to model the changes in growth parameters, stomatal properties, and WP of lettuce due to various scenarios of light intensity and CO2 concentration. The lettuce plants were exposed to four levels of light intensity [75, 150, 300, and 600 µmol m−2 s−1 Photosynthetic Photon Flux Density (PPFD)] and CO2 concentration (400, 800, 1200, and 1600 ppm). The results showed that growth parameters such as fresh weight, dry weight, and leaf area improved by increasing the PPFD and CO2 concentration from 75 to 300 µmol m−2 s−1 and 400–1200 ppm, respectively. Maximum fresh weight was recorded at 300 µmol m−2 s−1 PPFD and 1600 ppm CO2 concentration while the highest dry weight was obtained at 600 µmol m−2 s−1 PPFD and 1600 ppm CO2 concentration. Stomatal pore width and length decreased by increasing PPFD and CO2 concentration. Moreover, evapotranspiration increased when plants were exposed to higher PPFDs and CO2 concentrations. ANFIS predicted all growth parameters, stomatal properties, and WP with acceptable performance (R2 > 0.99, RMSE < 0.8 ×10−2). The findings provide agricultural engineers with an artificial intelligence-based model to predict the WP and production of lettuce by having the light intensity and CO2 concentration. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Artificial intelligence; Crop performance; Environmental cues; Photosynthetic photon flux density,Lactuca; Carbon dioxide; Crops; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy neural networks; Fuzzy systems; Photons; Plants (botany); Productivity; Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference; CO 2 concentration; Crop performance; Environmental cues; Growth parameters; Light intensity; Neuro-fuzzy inference systems; Photosynthetic photon flux densities; Property; Water productivity; adaptive management; assessment method; carbon dioxide; concentration (composition); crop production; fuzzy mathematics; herb; light intensity; prediction; Lettuce,Yes,Yes,Not Specified,"climate & meteorology, vegetation indices, plant physiology",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1

This study intends to anticipate droughts by studying the changes of an acceptable index using appropriate climatic factors. This study was divided into three phases, first being the determination of the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration (SPEI) index for the Cholistan, Punjab, Pakistan area based on a dataset spanning 1980 to 2020. The indices are calculated at different monthly intervals which could to predict short-term periods for the Cholistan in Pakistan, we selected two distinctive time periods of one month (SPEI–1) and three months (SPEI–3). The second phase involved dividing the data into three sample sizes, which were used for training data from 1980 to 2010, testing data from 2011 to 2015 and validation data from 2016 to 2020. The utilization of the random forest (RF) algorithm to train and evaluate the data using a variety of climate variables e.g. potential evapotranspiration, rainfall, vapor pressure cloud cover, and mean, minimum and maximum, temperature. The final phase was to analyze the performance of the model based on statistical metrics and drought classes. Based on these considerations, statistical measures, such as the Coefficient of Determination (R2) and the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) approach, were used to evaluate the performance of the test group throughout the testing period. The model's performance revealed the satisfactory results with R2 values of 0.80 and 0.78, for SPEI–1 and SPEI–3 situations, respectively. Following the data analysis, it was discovered that the validation period had a receiving operating curve and area under the Curve (ROC-AUC) of 0.87 for the SPEI–1 case and 0.85 for the SPEI–3 case. In this context, the results indicate that the SPEI may be useful as a prediction tool for drought prediction and the performances the RF model was suitable for both timescales. However, a more rigorous analysis with a larger dataset or a combination of datasets from different areas might be more beneficial for generalization over more extended time periods provide additional insights. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Drought forecasting; random forest; ROC-AUC; Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration index,Cholistan; Pakistan; Punjab [Pakistan]; agricultural production; algorithm; climate conditions; climate variation; data set; drought; evapotranspiration; machine learning; monitoring system; performance assessment; precipitation (climatology); rainfall; spatiotemporal analysis; standard (reference); timescale; water supply; weather forecasting,Yes,Yes,Not Specified,climate & meteorology,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

For assessing water demand ahead of time, FAO-56 Penman–Monteith (FAO-56 PM) equation is the traditional empirical method applied to obtain ETo. In real time, the precise calculation of ETo is genuinely troublesome and complex due to its complex mix of attributes. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)-based modelling techniques are employed to predict evapotranspiration. In this study, the viability of the deep learning neural network (DLNN) in predicting ETo on the data obtained in the command area of the Veeranam tank system during the period 1995–2016 in India is investigated. The predicted ETo obtained by DLNN is compared with ETo obtained by empirically calculated FAO-56 PM method.

Thus, crop, soil and meteorological factors are crucial, particularly in agricultural fields. Evapotranspiration is derived from latent heat component of surface energy balance and is a key factor to clarify the energy transfer mechanism. Development of the methods and technologies for the aim of determining and measuring of evapotranspiration have been one of the main focus points for researchers. However, the direct measurement systems are not common because of economic reasons. This situation causes that different methods are used to estimate evapotranspiration, particularly in locations where no measurements are made. Thus, in this study, non-linear techniques were applied to make accurate estimations of evapotranspiration over the winter wheat canopy located in the field of Atatürk Soil Water and Agricultural Meteorology Research Institute Directorate, Kırklareli, Turkey. This is the first attempt in the literature which consist of the comparison of different machine learning methods in the evapotranspiration values obtained by the Bowen Ratio Energy Balance system. In order to accomplish this aim, support-vector machine, Adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system and Artificial neural network models have been evaluated for different input combinations. The results revealed that even with only global solar radiation data taken as an input, a high prediction accuracy can be achieved. These results are particularly advantageous in cases where the measurement of meteorological variables is limited. With the results of this study, progress can be made in the efficient use and management of water resources based on the input parameters of evapotranspiration especially for regions with limited data. © 2021 E.E.

The currently available ET estimates have some uncertainties and need to be further improved. In this study, six machine learning methods including the random forests, support vector machine, Gaussian process regression (GPR), ensemble trees, general regression neural network, and Bayesian Model Averaging, are applied and evaluated to improve China terrestrial ET estimation by integrating five process-based ET algorithms including SEMI-PM, RS-PM, RRS-PM, MOD16, and PMLv2. Then evaluations are conducted with the eddy covariance flux observations at 14 China flux tower sites distributing in forest, shrub, wetland, grassland, and cropland, as well as with water balance-based ET at basin scale. According to the multiple training, validation, and testing, the GPR method is superior to all the other methods. Compared with the individual algorithms, the GPR method can reduce the root mean square error (RMSE) by 0.45 mm day−1 (for SEMI-PM) ~0.81 mm day−1 (for PMLv2), improve the coefficient of determination (R2) by 0.061 (for PMLv2) ~ 0.33 (for MOD16), and decrease the absolute relative percent error (RPE) by 8.32% (for RS-PM) ~42.47% (for PMLv2) for all the test data. At basin scale, the results demonstrate that the annual GPR-merged China terrestrial ET is reliable (R2 = 0.88, RMSE = 57.18 mm year−1, RPE = −0.26%) and has higher accuracy than the currently available eight high-resolution ET products and the estimates from the other five machine learning methods and the five single ET models. The annual average terrestrial ET across China for 2000–2018 estimated by the GPR method is approximately 397.65 mm year−1. More ground-based observations of terrestrial ET covering various land types should be collected to update the integrating methods and improve ET estimates.

The feasibility of novel hybrid inter-model ensembles as a catalyst to further improve the estimation of ET0 in a tropical climate region was investigated. The multilayer perceptron (MLP), support vector machine (SVM) and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) were used as base model to estimate ET0 at four meteorological stations of Peninsular Malaysia. Bootstrap aggregating, Bayesian model averaging (BMA) and extreme learning machine (ELM) based non-linear neural ensemble (NNE) were the three approaches used to hybridize the base models. The results showed that the bootstrap aggregating could not improve the performance of the base models by changing the data structure. The effectiveness of the BMA approach was constrained by the fact that it would favor the model with better accuracy. The whale optimization algorithm (WOA) optimized ELM operates in a black-box manner in order to compute the collective decisions of the MLP, SVM and ANFIS for estimating ET0. The WOA-ELM, free to combine the favorable traits and features of the base models had resulted in a hybrid model with higher accuracy as well as generalizability. The global performance indicator (GPI) was used to compare and rank the models from all aspects. The GPI ranking system justified that the inter-model ensemble developed using the WOA-ELM-E (ensemble) was the best model scoring the highest value.

As machine learning methods are widely applied in ETo estimation, we assess whether a high accuracy can be attained by stacking or integrating more models. Can the accuracy be increased indefinitely and at what cost? To this end, this study reports the first evaluation of stacking and blending ensemble models for daily ETo estimation. The stacking and blending models adopted a 2-layer structure: level-0 basic models included random forest (RF), support vector regression (SVR), multilayer perceptron neural network (MLP) and K-Nearest Neighbor regression (KNN); level-1 outputted the final result via linear regression (LR). The accuracy and computational costs of stacking and blending models were compared with those of the 4 basic models and 3 empirical models under 5 complete and limited input conditions. A station-cross validation on models with solar radiation input was further performed to study the portability of the tested models. The results indicated that both stacking and blending models performed better than the basic and empirical models regardless of input combination, and the former (R2 ranged from 0.6602 to 0.9977, with an average AIC of −7785.68) achieved a slightly higher accuracy than the latter models (R2: 0.6562–0.9974; average AIC: −7689.68). Meanwhile, the stacking and blending models were more portable (RMSE ranged from 0.5445 to 0.8799 and 0.5511–0.8767 mm day−1, respectively) than basic models across stations in different climate zones. In terms of computational cost, both stacking and blending models were able to achieve significantly better accuracy than basic models in reasonable time with smaller training data size, while the blending models could obtain similar high accuracy to stacking models in less time after increasing the size of the training data. Therefore, the stacking and blending ensemble models can be highly recommend for ETo estimation, especially when the available training data set or meteorological variables are limited. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Blending ensemble learning method; Computational costs comparison; Portability analysis; Reference evapotranspiration estimation; Stacking ensemble learning method,Climate models; Decision trees; Evapotranspiration; Learning systems; Multilayer neural networks; Nearest neighbor search; Regression analysis; Weather forecasting; Blending ensemble learning method; Blending models; Computational cost comparison; High-accuracy; Portability analyse; Reference evapotranspiration; Reference evapotranspiration estimation; Stacking ensemble learning method; Stacking models; Stackings; accuracy assessment; artificial neural network; ensemble forecasting; evapotranspiration; learning; prediction; solar radiation; Blending,Yes,Yes,weather station,"climate & meteorology, vegetation indices",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0

Nevertheless, several studies have shown good results when implementing empirical regression formulae that, despite their simplicity, are comparable in accuracy to more complex models. Although many types of regression formulae to estimate ETa exist, there is no consensus on what variables must be included in the analysis. In this research, we used machine learning algorithms—through implementation of empirical linear regression for-mulae—to find the main variables that control daily and monthly ETa in arid cold regions, where there is a lack of available ETa data. Meteorological data alone and then combined with remote sensing vegetation indices (VIs) were used as input in ETa estimations. In situ ETa and meteorological data were obtained from ten sites in Chile, Australia, and the United States. Our results indicate that the available energy is the main meteorological variable that controls ETa in the assessed sites, despite the fact that these regions are typically described as water-limited environments. The VI that better represents the in situ ETa is the Normalized Difference Water Index, which represents water availability in plants and soils. The best performance of the regression equations in the validation sites was obtained for monthly estimates with the incorporation of VIs (R2 = 0.82), whereas the worst performance of these equations was obtained for monthly ETa estimates when only meteorological data were considered. Incorporation of remote-sensing information results in better ETa estimates compared to when only meteorological data are considered. © 2021 by the authors.

This study proposed two optimization methods, i.e., particle swarm optimization (PSO) and genetic algorithm (GA), to determine the input weights and hidden biases of extreme learning machine (ELM), and developed two novel hybrid GA-ELM and PSO-ELM models for ETo estimations with limited input data. A temporal and spatial scanning strategy that can avoid misleading or partially valid results was applied to train and test the models, using daily climatic data during 1994–2016 from 96 meteorological stations across various climates of China. The results revealed that GA-ELM and PSO-ELM could quantify ETo on daily, monthly, and annual time scales, with GA-ELM (with model efficiency ranging from 0.80 to 0.97) performing better than PSO-ELM (with model efficiency ranging from 0.70 to 0.93) in all climates. The temperature-based GA-ELM only with air temperature data as forcing input has relatively accurate ETo estimates across different environments, and can be recommended as an alternative method when radiation data are not available. Spatial assessment reveals that the machine learning models trained by external data also offer accurate ETo estimates, confirming the applicability of models for ETo estimations elsewhere without the model training or when local data for model training are unavailable. Overall, the GA-ELM model provides accurate ETo estimates on various time scales and exhibits superior performance than the PSO-ELM model, and thus can be recommended for ETo estimations using limited data as model forcing in different climates of China.

Numerous methods have been proposed previously, including look-up table approaches, parametric methods, process-based models, and machine learning. Particularly, the REddyProc package from the Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry and ONEFlux package from AmeriFlux have been widely used in many studies. However, there is no consensus regarding the optimal model and feature selection method that could be used for predicting different flux targets (Net Ecosystem Exchange, NEE; or Evapotranspiration –ET), due to the limited systematic comparative research based on the identical site-data. Here, we compared NEE and ET gap-filling/prediction performance of the least-square-based linear model, artificial neural network, random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM) using data obtained from four major row-crop and forage agroecosystems located in the subtropical or the climate-transition zones in the US. Additionally, we tested the impacts of different training-testing data partitioning settings, including a 10-fold time-series sequential (10FTS), a 10-fold cross validation (CV) routine with single data point (10FCV), daily (10FCVD), weekly (10FCVW) and monthly (10FCVM) gap length, and a 7/14-day flanking window (FW) approach; and implemented a novel Sliced Inverse Regression-based Recursive Feature Elimination algorithm (SIRRFE). We benchmarked the model performance against REddyProc and ONEFlux-produced results. Our results indicated that accurate NEE and ET prediction models could be systematically constructed using SVM/RF and only a few top informative features. The gap-filling performance of ONEFlux is generally satisfactory (R2 = 0.39–0.71), but results from REddyProc could be very limited or even unreliable in many cases (R2 = 0.01–0.67). Overall, SIRRFE-refined SVM models yielded excellent results for predicting NEE (R2 = 0.46–0.92) and ET (R2 = 0.74–0.91). Finally, the performance of various models was greatly affected by the types of ecosystem, predicting targets, and training algorithms; but was insensitive towards training-testing partitioning.

It can be calculated using different empirical equations and forecasted by applying various artificial intelligence techniques. The simulation result of a machine learning technique is a function of its structure and model inputs. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of using the optimum set of time lags for model inputs on the prediction accuracy of monthly ET0 using an artificial neural network (ANN). For this, the weather data time-series i.e. minimum and maximum air temperatures, vapour pressure, sunshine hours, and wind speed were collected from six meteorological stations in Serbia for the period 1980–2010. Three ANN models were applied to monthly ET0 time-series to study the impacts of using the optimum time lags for input time-series on the performance of ANN model. Achieved results of goodness–of–fit statistics approved the results obtained by scatterplots of testing sets - using more time lags that are selected based on their correlation to the dataset is more efficient for monthly ET0 prediction. It was realized that all the developed models showed the best performances at Loznica and Vranje stations and the worst performances at Nis station.

This research aims to develop a framework for the regional AET evaluation and prediction based on multiple machine learning methods and multi-source remote sensing data, which combines Boruta algorithm, Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Regression (SVR) models, employing datasets from CRU, GLDAS, MODIS, GRACE (-FO), and CMIP6, covering meteorological, vegetation, and hydrological variables. To verify the framework, it is applied to grids of South America (SA) as a case. The results meticulously demonstrate the tendency of AET and identify the decisive role of T, P, and NDVI on AET in SA. Regarding the projection, RF has better performance in different input strategies in SA. According to the accuracy of RF and SVR on the pixel scale, the AET prediction dataset is generated by integrating the optimal results of the two models. By using multiple parameter inputs and two models to jointly obtain the optimal output, the results become more reasonable and accurate. The framework can systematically and comprehensively evaluate and forecast AET; although prediction products generated in SA cannot calibrate relevant parameters, it provides a quite valuable reference for regional drought warning and water allocating. © 2021 by the authors.

In this study, five machine learning (ML) algorithms, namely (i) Logistic Regression, (ii) Support Vector Machine, (iii) K-nearest neighbor, (iv) Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost) and (v) Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), were tested for Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC), India, to evaluate their clustering abilities to classify locations (flooded or non-flooded) for climate change scenarios. A geo-spatial database, with eight flood influencing factors, namely, rainfall, elevation, slope, distance from nearest stream, evapotranspiration, land surface temperature, normalised difference vegetation index and curve number, was developed for 2000, 2006 and 2016. XGBoost performed the best, with the highest mean area under curve score of 0.83.

The current study is emphasized on the implementation of evolutionary computing models (i.e., gene expression programming (GEP)) for the simulation daily ETo in different locations of Peninsular Malaysia. The ETo models are developed using various input combinations of meteorological variables including air temperature (mean, maximum, and minimum), relative humidity, solar radiation, and mean wind speed. The in situ measurements of the ET are used to validate the model’s performance. The performance of the proposed GEP model is also compared with five well-established empirical formulations (EFs) developed based on the related climatological variability. The attained results evidenced the potential of GEP-derived ETo models in terms of all the statistical measures used. The best GEP model attained when all the meteorological variables are incorporated. However, the study revealed that the use of only temperature information can provide substantial predictability compared to EFs at all the studied stations across Peninsular Malaysia. This confirms the applicability of GEP in simulating ETo with fewer meteorological variables. The major advantage of GEP compared to other black box artificial intelligence algorithms is that GEP provides a set of equations which can be used by practitioners for reliable estimation of ETo at field with a fewer meteorological variable and, thus, can have wide applicability in water resources management. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.",,Malaysia; West Malaysia; evapotranspiration; in situ measurement; meteorology; numerical method; performance assessment; water management,Yes,Yes,weather station,"climate & meteorology, vegetation indices",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0

However, phenotyping of such dynamic physiology-based traits has been immensely challenging especially due to the limited availability of adequate methods that can provide continuous measurements of plant-water relations. Therefore, gravimetric phenotyping of plants is being increasingly used to allow one-to-one monitoring of plant-water relations and generate continuous evapotranspiration (ET) profiles. The gravimetric sensors or load cells can provide ET estimates at very high frequencies, e.g. 15-min interval, as chosen by the user. There is however, no study on understanding the optimum frequency or the sampling time at which ET needs to be monitored, such that data-redundancy, noise and processing overhead could be reduced. Hence, this paper makes a novel attempt in identifying the optimum sampling time for phenotyping ET from load cells time series. The proposed procedure includes an ensemble Machine-Learning (ML) approach for optimizing the sampling time through time series forecasting of ET profiles and classification of genotypes using the forecasted ET values. High-frequency load cells data from the LeasyScan, HTP platform, ICRISAT were used to derive the ET profiles at frequencies or scales varying from 15-min to 180-min, followed by ET forecasting and classification at each frequency. For both forecasting and classification, an ensemble of three ML algorithms i.e. Support Vector Machines (SVM), Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Random Forests (RF) were leveraged. Consequently, the performance metrics (of both the operations) obtained from the ensemble were used to compute the entropy-based optimum sampling time. The results reveal that 60-min interval HTP data could be credibly used for both, forecasting ET as well as correctly classifying the genotypes. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Ensemble machine learning; Evapotranspiration; High throughput phenotyping; Sampling time optimization; Time series classification; Time series forecasting,Decision trees; Evapotranspiration; Forecasting; Learning systems; Neural networks; Time series; Weighing; Continuous measurements; Environmental conditions; High frequency loads; High-throughput phenotyping; Machine learning approaches; Plant water relations; Processing overhead; Time series forecasting; artificial neural network; ensemble forecasting; evapotranspiration; flood frequency; frequency analysis; sensor; signal-to-noise ratio; time series; Support vector machines,Yes,Yes,"load cells, phenotyping","climate & meteorology, vegetation indices, plant physiology",0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1

We recently have shown that VOD is related to plant productivity, i.e., gross primary production (GPP). Based on this relationship between VOD and GPP, we developed a theory-based machine learning model to estimate global patterns of GPP from passive microwave VOD retrievals. The VOD-GPP model generally showed good agreement with site observations and other global data sets in temporal dynamic but tended to overestimate annual GPP across all latitudes. We hypothesized that the reason for the overestimation is the missing effect of temperature on autotrophic respiration in the theory-based machine learning model. Here we aim to further assess and enhance the robustness of the VOD-GPP model by including the effect of temperature on autotrophic respiration within the machine learning approach and by assessing the interannual variability of the model results with respect to water availability. We used X-band VOD from the VOD Climate Archive (VODCA) data set for estimating GPP and used global state-of-the-art GPP data sets from FLUXCOM and MODIS to assess residuals of the VOD-GPP model with respect to drought conditions as quantified by the Standardized Precipitation and Evaporation Index (SPEI).</p> <p>Our results reveal an improvement in model performance for correlation when including the temperature dependency of autotrophic respiration (average correlation increase of 0.18). This improvement in temporal dynamic is larger for temperate and cold regions than for the tropics. For unbiased root-mean-square error (ubRMSE) and bias, the results are regionally diverse and are compensated in the global average. Improvements are observed in temperate and cold regions, while decreases in performance are obtained mainly in the tropics. The overall improvement when adding temperature was less than expected and thus may only partly explain previously observed differences between the global GPP data sets. On interannual timescales, estimates of the VOD-GPP model agree well with GPP from FLUXCOM and MODIS. We further find that the residuals between VOD-based GPP estimates and the other data sets do not significantly correlate with SPEI, which demonstrates that the VOD-GPP model can capture responses of GPP to water availability even without including additional information on precipitation, soil moisture or evapotranspiration. Exceptions from this rule were found in some regions: significant negative correlations between VOD-GPP residuals and SPEI were observed in the US corn belt, Argentina, eastern Europe, Russia and China, while significant positive correlations were obtained in South America, Africa and Australia. In these regions, the significant correlations may indicate different plant strategies for dealing with variations in water availability.</p> <p>Overall, our findings support the robustness of global microwave-derived estimates of gross primary production for large-scale studies on climate-vegetation interactions.</p>  © Copyright: ",,,Yes,Yes,remote sensing,"climate & meteorology, vegetation indices, soil",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0
1242,Gautam D.; Ostendorf B.; Pagay V.,Estimation of grapevine crop coefficient using a multispectral camera on an unmanned aerial vehicle,2021,10.3390/rs13132639,"Crop water status and irrigation requirements are of great importance to the horticultural industry due to changing climatic conditions leading to high evaporative demands, drought and water scarcity in semi-arid and arid regions worldwide. Irrigation scheduling strategies based on evapotranspiration (ET), such as regulated deficit irrigation, requires the estimation of seasonal crop coefficients (kc ). The ET-driven irrigation decisions for grapevines rely on the sampling of several kc values from each irrigation zone. Here, we present an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based technique to estimate kc at the single vine level in order to capture the spatial variability of water requirements in a commercial vineyard located in South Australia. A UAV carrying a multispectral sensor is used to extract the spectral, as well as the structural, information of Cabernet Sauvignon grapevines. The spectral and structural information, acquired at the various phenological stages of the vine through two seasons, is used to model kc using univariate (simple linear), multivariate (generalised linear and additive) and machine learning (convolution neural network and random forest) model frameworks. The structural information (e.g., canopy top view area) had the strongest correlation with kc throughout the season (p ≤ 0.001; Pearson R = 0.56), while the spectral indices (e.g., normalised indices) turned less-sensitive post véraison—the onset of ripening in grapes. Combining structural and spectral information improved the model’s performance. Among the investigated predictive models, the random forest predicted kc with the highest accuracy (R2: 0.675, root mean square error: 0.062, and mean absolute error: 0.047). This UAV-based approach improves the precision of irrigation by capturing the spatial variability of kc within a vineyard. Combined with an energy balance model, the water needs of a vineyard can be computed on a weekly or sub-weekly basis for precision irrigation. The UAV-based characterisation of kc can further enhance the water management and irrigation zoning by matching the infrastructure with the spatial variability of the irrigation demand. © 2021 by the authors.

In these regions, the impossibility of collecting all the required data to compute FAO-56 Penman–Monteith equation (FAO56-PM) makes scientists search new methodologies to accurately estimate ET0 with the minimum number of climatic parameters. In this work, several neural network approaches have been evaluated for estimating ET0 using datasets from five weather stations located in Southern Spain (semiarid region of Andalusia). The assessment of statistical performance (Root Mean Square Error -RMSE-, Mean Bias Error -MBE-, coefficient of determination -R2- and Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient -NSE-) of models namely Multilayer perceptron (MLP), Generalized Regression Neural Network (GRNN), Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest (RF) and XGBoost were carried out using different input variables configurations. Only temperature-based data were used as inputs; the calculation of new variables called EnergyT (the integral of the half hourly temperature values of a day) and Hourmin (the difference in hours between time sunset and the time when the maximum temperature occurs) had promising results for the most humid stations. The good results obtained with EnergyT when it is used as an input of the system demonstrated that the information contained on it gives detailed characterization of the daily thermic behavior at each location, resulting in a more efficient model than those using only daily maximum, minimum temperature and extraterrestrial radiation values. In general, the modeling results showed that no model firmly outperformed the others, although MLP and ELM were commonly the models that gave the best performances for all sites: mean values of R2 > 0.89, mean values of NSE > 0.88, mean values of RMSE < 0.67 mm/day and mean values of MBE ranging from −0.17 to 0.30 mm/day. Therefore, EnergyT and Hourmin can be used to estimate ET0 more accurately in stations where data acquisition is limited, like in developing countries or at low-cost weather stations that cannot collect all the required meteorological variables used in FAO56-PM. Overall, the use of ELM is recommended due to its high performance in terms of efficiency (NSE) for all the configurations and for all locations, especially using EnergyT as an input variable. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Irrigation scheduling; Machine learning; Reference evapotranspiration,Spain; Arid regions; Data acquisition; Decision trees; Developing countries; Efficiency; Evapotranspiration; Mean square error; Multilayer neural networks; Support vector machines; Support vector regression; Weather information services; Coefficient of determination; Crop water requirements; Extreme learning machine; Generalized Regression Neural Network(GRNN); Machine learning approaches; Meteorological variables; Reference evapotranspiration; Statistical performance; developing world; diurnal variation; energy efficiency; evapotranspiration; humid environment; machine learning; Penman-Monteith equation; semiarid region; weather station; Learning systems,Yes,Yes,"weather station, empirical models","climate & meteorology, vegetation indices",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0

One of the tools to predict ET0 is to employ machine learning algorithms that predict near future ET0 values based on past values from the ET0 timeseries. The aim of this research is to provide one-step ahead predictions of ET0 with different deep and machine learning methods using calculated past values of ET0. In this context, daily values of ET0 were computed via the FAO-56 Penman-Monteith approach that employ five climatic variables. For predicting one-step ahead ET0, this study evaluates the prediction accuracy and estimation capability of deep learning algorithms, i.e., a Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) and a bi-directional LSTM (Bi-LSTM) network. The prediction performances of the LSTM and Bi-LSTM were compared with those of a Sequence-to-Sequence Regression LSTM network (SSR-LSTM) and an Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS). According to the findings, all four methods produced one-step ahead ET0 amounts in satisfactory precision and error levels with Correlation Coefficient, Index of Agreement, and a20-index ranging from 0.698 to 0.999, 0.833 to 0.999, and 0.624 to 1.0, respectively. Results further revealed the superiority of Bi-LSTM followed by SSR-LSTM, ANFIS and LSTM models identified by the ranking values computed using Shannon’s Entropy. The overall results indicate that the Bi-LSTM model could be successfully employed to predict one-step ahead ET0 values quite precisely. Highlights: Deep learning models (LSTM, Bi-LSTM) are proposed to predict one-step ahead ET0.Performances of deep learning models are compared with an ANFIS model.Partial Autocorrelation Functions determine the inputs to deep learning models.Entropy-based decision theory is used to rank the performances of developed models. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",ANFIS; Long short-term memory networks; Reference evapotranspiration; Sequence to sequence regression; Shannon’s entropy,Brain; Decision theory; Deep learning; Evapotranspiration; Forecasting; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy neural networks; Fuzzy systems; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Tropics; Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system; Autocorrelation functions; Correlation coefficient; Index of agreements; Irrigation scheduling; Machine learning methods; Prediction performance; Reference evapotranspiration; accuracy assessment; computer simulation; error analysis; estimation method; evaporation; evapotranspiration; fuzzy mathematics; irrigation; machine learning; memory; precision; regression analysis; water resource; Long short-term memory,Yes,Yes,empirical models,climate & meteorology,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

Method: During the test, the experiment adopted different field capacities for B. chinensis var. parachinensis at the vegetative growth stage (V stage) and reproductive growth stage (R stage), collected the canopy temperature, air temperature and humidity data, established non-transpiration-baseline (upper limit equation), non-water-stress-baseline (lower limit equation), and calculated CWSI by empirical formulation. Cluster method of density-based spatial clustering of application with noise and air temperature were used to study the upper limit distribution of canopy temperature minus air temperature of B. chinensis var. parachinensis, and the fixed values were selected as the upper limit. Based on the CWSI empirical formulation, CWSI was calculated using the non-transpiration-baselines with different temperature fixed values to verify the clustering effect. In order to obtain the photosynthetic rate more easily, four machine learning methods of k-nearest neighbor (KNN), support vector regression (SVR), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) and random forest (RF) were used for prediction, and the prediction effects were compared. Result: Under different field capacities, CWSI could better monitor the water stress status of B. chinensis var. parachinensis. Through cluster analysis, the upper limit of canopy temperature minus air temperature at V stage and R stage was classified into two clusters, and the cluster centers were 3.4 and 4.2 ℃, respectively, which were significantly correlated with the values calculated by the empirical formula of CWSI, indicating that it was feasible to use a fixed value as the upper limit of canopy temperature minus air temperature in B. chinensis var. parachinensis. The prediction models of KNN, SVM, XGBoost and RF all achieved good results, and the correlation coefficients were 0.873, 0.877, 0.887 and 0.863, respectively. Conclusion: Machine learning can be used for predicting the photosynthetic rate of B. chinensis var. parachinensis, avoid the use of large and cumbersome instruments, reduce the damage to the leaves of B. chinensis var. parachinensis, and reduce the measurement time.

The lack of rapid access to the high-resolution spatial and temporal distribution of Kc values hinders obtaining a crop Kc value for application in precision irrigation agriculture. This study aimed to explore the potential of leaf area index (LAI) and multispectral vegetation indices (VIs) obtained by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) for estimating the Kc value for a maize crop on a field scale and to obtain a high-resolution spatial-temporal map of Kc values. Hence, the performance of the estimation model for daily maize Kc derived by two machine learning algorithms (random forest regression-RFR and multiple linear regression-MLR) based on the ground-based LAI and six types of UAV-based multispectral VIs (normalized difference vegetation index, NDVI; soil adjusted vegetation index, SAVI; enhanced vegetation index, EVI; transformed chlorophyll absorption in reflectance index, TCARI; green normalized vegetation index, GNDVI; and visual atmospheric resistance index, VARI), was evaluated under multiple irrigation conditions during the entire cropping cycle. Maize RFR with VIs-LAI-based ET was compared to soil water balance (SWB) and FAO-56-based ET. The results showed that the RFR algorithm effectively (R2 = 0.65) estimated maize Kc values based on ground-based LAI and UAV-based VIs. The UAV-based VIs based on Red-edge-Red and Green-Red spectral bands and ground-based LAI were suitable predictors in the Kc prediction model under different irrigation conditions. Further, we successfully obtained a high resolution (pixel size of centimeter) spatial distribution of maize Kc values based on EVI-based LAI and UAV-based VIs. Furthermore, the results indicated that the combination of UAV multispectral remote sensing technology and the RFR algorithm provides a potential solution for the distribution of water use and precision irrigation on a field scale. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Crop water requirements; Evapotranspiration; FAO56 approach; LAI; Random forest regression; Remote sensing,Antennas; Decision trees; Evapotranspiration; Irrigation; Learning algorithms; Linear regression; Machine learning; Remote sensing; Soil moisture; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Vegetation; Water supply; Aerial vehicle; C values; Crop water requirements; FAO56 approach; High resolution; Leaf Area Index; Multispectral; Random forest regression; Remote-sensing; Vegetation index; aerial survey; algorithm; evapotranspiration; leaf area index; machine learning; maize; mapping method; NDVI; spectral analysis; unmanned vehicle; vegetation index; Crops,Yes,Yes,"remote sensing, field measurement, empirical models","climate & meteorology, vegetation indices",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0

In addition to multispectral images, we use terrain attributes derived from a digital elevation model and hydrological variables of precipitation and potential evapotranspiration as covariates to predict surface soil moisture. We tested four different machine learning algorithms and interrogated the models to rank the importance of different variables and to understand their relationship with surface soil moisture. All the machine learning algorithms we tested were able to predict soil moisture with good accuracy. The boosted regression tree algorithm was marginally the best, with a mean absolute error of 3.8 % volumetric moisture content. Variable importance analysis revealed that the four most important variables were precipitation, reflectance in the red wavelengths, potential evapotranspiration, and topographic position indices (TPI). Our results demonstrate that the dynamics of soil water status across heterogeneous terrain may be adequately described and predicted by UAS remote sensing and machine learning.

The promotion of maize physiological growth by (AMF) has been studied. However, studies of the effects of AMF on the leaf chlorophyll content of maize under water stress as observed through spectral information are rare. In this study, a pot experiment was carried out to spectrally estimate the leaf chlorophyll content of maize subjected to different durations (20, 35, and 55 days); degrees of water stress (75%, 55% and 35% water supply) and two inoculation treatments (inoculation with Funneliformis mosseae and no inoculation). Three machine learning algorithms, including the back propagation (BP) method, least square support vector machine (LSSVM) and random forest (RF) method, were used to estimate the leaf chlorophyll content of maize. The results showed that AMF increased the leaf chlorophyll content, net photosynthetic rate (A), stomatal conductance (gs), transpiration rate (E), and water use efficiency (WUE) of maize but decreased the intercellular carbon dioxide concentration (Ci) of maize and atmospheric vapor pressure deficit (VPD) regardless of the water stress duration and degree. The first-order differential spectral data can better reflect the correlation between leaf chlorophyll content and spectrum of inoculated maize when compared with original spectral data. The BP model performed bestin modeling the maize leaf chlorophyll content, yielding the largest R2-values and smallest root mean square error (RMSE) values, regardless of stress duration. These results provide a reliable basis for the effective monitoring of the leaf chlorophyll content of maize under water stress. © Copyright © 2021 Sun, Yang, Yang, Wei, Li, Guo and Kong.",arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi; leaf chlorophyll content; machine learning algorithms; spectral reflectance; water stress,,Yes,Yes,Not Specified,"climate & meteorology, plant physiology",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1

Metrological and biophysical predictors that drive ET in managed landscapes have complex nonlinear relationships. Deep learning and data-driven methods have shown promising performance for identifying the dependencies among variables. Here, we evaluated the potentials of random forest (RF) and long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks to estimate and forecast daily ET for corn, soybeans, and potatoes in diverse agricultural farms during 2003–2019. The modeling framework was applied for nineteen fields where eddy covariance ET and meteorological observations in the Midwest USA for growing season (April-October) is available. In this study, we applied data-driven models (RF and LSTM) with 3 sets of predictors (5, 11, and 16 predictors). Results show that a 16 predictor RF model (RF_16 R2 = 0.7, Willmott's skill score = 0.90) outperformed a process-based land surface model (LSM R2 = 0.57, Willmott's skill score = 0.86) for predicting daily ET, while LSTM performance was lower (LSTM_16 R2 = 0.65, Willmott's skill score = 0.89 and LSTM_11 R2 = 0.62, Willmott's skill score = 0.86) than RF using the same sets of predictors. Vapor pressure and crop coefficients were identified as the most important predictors for irrigated crops, while short wave radiation and enhanced vegetation index were key predictors for non-irrigated crops. For certain crop types, such as corn and soybeans on fine-grained soils (silt loam), a simpler version RF, using only 11 drivers, can provide comparable results (R2 = 0.70 vs 0.69 and Willmott's skill score = 0.90 vs 0.88). For short-term 3-day ET forecasting, LSTM is more sensitive to uncertainty in ensemble forecast meteorology than RF. ET forecasts were strongly sensitive to forecast uncertainty of vapor pressure. The proposed modeling architecture provides a field-scale, locally calibrated tool for accurate prediction and short-term forecasting of daily ET in areas where in situ ET, metrological, and biophysical data are lacking. © 2021",Agriculture; Drought; Evapotranspiration; Forecasting; Irrigation; Machine learning,Midwest; United States; Glycine max; Solanum tuberosum; Crops; Decision trees; Digital storage; Drought; Evapotranspiration; Hydrostatic pressure; Irrigation; Long short-term memory; Plants (botany); Silt; Water supply; Daily evapotranspirations; Forecasting modeling; Irrigated crops; Machine-learning; Prediction and forecasting; Prediction model; Random forests; Short term memory; Skill Score; Vapour pressures; agricultural land; crop plant; eddy covariance; evapotranspiration; growing season; intensive agriculture; land surface; spatiotemporal analysis; Forecasting,Yes,Yes,"eddy covariance, weather station","climate & meteorology, vegetation indices",1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0

A novel Gaussian exponential model (GEM) was developed in this study to predict ET0 with limited climatic data. The GEM was further compared with the M5 model tree (M5T), extreme learning machine (ELM), and boosted trees (BT) model under local and regional scenarios. Daily meteorological data during 1997–2016 from four stations in Northeast China were used to develop and validate the model. The results showed that the models considering solar radiation and relative humidity demonstrated considerably higher accuracy than those using other inputs. The GEM demonstrated higher accuracy among the four machine learning models for different stations. The accuracy of GEM under local scenarios was higher than that under regional scenarios with the root mean square error (RMSE) reducing by 0.025–0.046 mm/d, relative root mean square error (RRMSE) reducing by 0.879–2.022%, coefficient of efficiency (Ens) increasing by 0.008–0.026, the coefficients of determination (R2) increasing by 0.008–0.026, and mean absolute error (MAE) reducing by 0.015–0.033 mm/d. The GEM considering solar radiation had the highest accuracy with the global performance indicator (GPI) of 1.876. It can also be seen from the Taylor diagrams that the GEM has the the lowest standard deviation and mean square error and the highest correlation coefficient with the standard values. In general, the GEM considering solar radiation had the lowest error and the highest consistency and could be recommended for ET0 simulation for Northeast China. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Gaussian exponential model; Limited climatic data; Local and regional scenarios; Machine learning models; Reference crop evapotranspiration,China; Machine Learning; Meteorology; Normal Distribution; China; Indicator indicator; crop plant; data set; evapotranspiration; machine learning; relative humidity; simulation; solar radiation; spatiotemporal analysis; China; machine learning; meteorology; normal distribution,Yes,Yes,weather station,"climate & meteorology, vegetation indices",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0

To improve the accuracy for predicting actual evapotranspiration and crop coefficient of maize under mulched drip irrigation, in this study, a Stacking Ensemble Learning Model (LSM) was developed to estimate evapotranspiration and crop coefficient of maize under drip irrigation with plastic film mulch. The LSM model included four classical machine learning methods including Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Back Propagation Neural Network (BP), and Adaboost (ADA). The maximal information coefficient (MIC) method was applied to calculate the MIC value between ten proposed features, including days after sowing, average temperature, plant height, leaf area index, solar radiation, extraterrestrial radiation, relative humidity, surface soil temperature, surface soil water content and wind speed at 2 m, and maize evapotranspiration. The MIC values were used to evaluate the importance of ten features. The results showed that in the test dataset the LSM model improved the coefficient of determination (R2) and decreased Normal Root Mean Square (NRMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MSE), and Mean Square Error (MSE), compared to SVM, RF, and ADA model. The BP model had the lowest R2 and the highest NRMSE. It revealed that the LSM model obtained the highest precision for modeling maize evapotranspiration, followed by SVM, ADA, and RF model, and BP model had the poorest performance for modeling maize evapotranspiration. Similarly, compared to four classical machine learning models, the LSM model increased R2 and decreased NRMSE, MSE, and MAE, indicating that LSM increased the precision for modelling maize crop coefficient under drip irrigation with film mulch. The MIC values of days after planting, average daily air temperature, leaf area index, plant height, and solar radiation were higher than those of the other features. It indicated that the five features above are important for maize evapotranspiration. Besides, compared to the LSM model with input of five top features, the LSM model with input of all the ten features didn't show any obvious improvement in model simulation since the R2 was increased little and the NRMSE value was decreased by less than 0.05. The average crop coefficient values obtained by the LSM model with input of five top features were increased by 4%, 0, and -4.3% at developed stage, midseason stage, and late stage of maize, respectively, compared to the actual value. However, the crop coefficient values based on FAO-56 recommendation were 17.3%, 8.3%, and 13.8% lower or higher than actual crop coefficient in maize developed stage, mid stage, and late stage, respectively. This result indicated that the average crop coefficient values of LSM model with input of five top features were closer to actual crop coefficient value than that modified by FAO-56. Thus, the LSM model with input of days after planting, average daily air temperature, leaf area index, plant height, and solar radiation was recommended to estimate evapotranspiration and crop coefficient of maize under drip irrigation with plastic film mulch. © 2021, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

Nevertheless, direct measurement of T is difficult, expensive, destructive and time-consuming. This study explored the applicability of support vector machines (SVM), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), single-layer artificial neural networks (ANN) and deep neural networks (DNN) models for estimating daily T of summer maize in Northwest China. Four input combinations of meteorological (Tmax, Tmin, RH, U and Rs), soil (SWC) and crop (LAI) variables were employed to explore the effects of various variables on daily T estimation. The whole dataset during the four maize growing seasons of 2015–2018 were randomly divided into two subsets: 80% for model training and 20% for model testing. The results showed that the performances of the four machine learning models improved by 10.1–13.1%, 15.7–23.8% and 36.1–46.2% in terms of RMSE during testing when SWC (0.556–0.675 mm d−1), LAI (0.477–0.621 mm d−1) and both of them (0.344–0.482 mm d−1) were further incorporated respectively, compared to models with only meteorological variables as inputs (0.621–0.754 mm d−1). DNN models (R2 = 0.816–954, RMSE = 0.344–0.621 d−1, MAE = 0.256–0.445 mm d−1 and NSE = 0.902–0.972) slightly outperformed SVM models (R2 = 0.731–0.948, RMSE = 0.370–0.688 mm d−1, MAE = 0.286–0.500 mm d−1 and NSE = 0.880–0.967) during testing, followed by XGBoost models (R2 = 0.739–0.929, RMSE = 0.455–0.721 mm d−1, MAE = 0.355–0.519 mm;d−1 and NSE = 0.872–0.947) and ANN models (R2 = 0.683–0.913, RMSE = 0.482–0.754 mm d−1, MAE = 0.368–0.545 mm d−1 and NSE = 0.840–0.936) under the four input combinations. The incorporation of SWC or/and LAI in the machine learning models is highly recommended for accurate daily maize T estimation. The DNN model is more effective for daily maize T estimation due to its advantage in modeling high-order complex relationships between T and its driving variables through multiple levels of feature abstraction. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Artificial neural networks; Deep neural networks; Extreme gradient boosting; Support vector machines; Transpiration,China; Agricultural robots; Crops; Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Multilayer neural networks; Network layers; Statistical tests; Support vector machines; Transpiration; Accurate measurement; Agricultural productions; Complex relationships; Feature abstraction; Machine learning models; Maize growing season; Meteorological variables; Neural networks model; artificial neural network; crop yield; estimation method; growing season; leaf area index; maize; model; support vector machine; support vessel; transpiration; Learning systems,Yes,Yes,weather station,vegetation indices,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

ET0 forecasting using numerical weather prediction (NWP) has been proved to be an effective method, but this method usually requires bias correction. A bias correction method (M3) for the forecast weather factors from the global ensemble forecast system (GEFSv2) was established based on the LightGBM machine learning method and the data of nine meteorological stations in Northwest China. In this method, solar radiation, maximum and minimum temperature, relative humidity and wind speed were used to reforecast each meteorological factor respectively, and then ET0 was calculated. The performance of the M3 model was evaluated by equidistant cumulative distribution function (EDCDFm, M1) and LightGBM method (M2) with single meteorological factor as input. The results showed that there was a mismatch between the forecast factors of GEFSv2 and the corresponding observed meteorological factors. The degree of mismatch varied with the meteorological factors. The matching degree of solar radiation was the highest, and relative humidity was the lowest. The newly established M3 model was superior to both M1 and M2 methods in predicting meteorological factors. In terms of ET0 forecasting, the average root mean squared error (RMSE) of M1, M2 and M3 were in the range of 0.66~0.93 mm/d, 0.57~0.83 mm/d and 0.53~0.79 mm/d at nine stations, the mean squared error (MAE) were in the range of 0.44~0.61 mm/d, 0.38~0.56 mm/d and 0.35~0.53 mm/d, and the R2 were 0.82~0.91, 0.84~0.93 and 0.86~0.94, respectively. The error of the three methods were the largest in summer, and the average RMSE from 1 day to 16 days were 1.21 mm/d, 1.18 mm/d and 1.04 mm/d, respectively. Among all forecasting factors, solar radiation had the greatest influence on ET0 forecasting error, followed by wind speed, maximum temperature, relative humidity and minimum temperature. In the post-process, the maximum temperature forecast value of NWP had the largest contribution to the forecast of other factors, while the contribution of relative humidity was the least. It was suggested that data mismatch should be considered in NWP bias correction, and multi-factor correction should be used to improve the prediction accuracy. © 2021, Chinese Society of Agricultural Machinery.

We tested the application of hyperspectral reflectance as a high-throughput phenotyping approach for early identification of water stress and rapid assessment of leaf photosynthetic traits in citrus trees by conducting a greenhouse experiment. To this end, photosynthetic CO2 assimilation rate (Pn), stomatal conductance (Cond) and transpiration rate (Trmmol) were measured with gas-exchange approaches alongside measurements of leaf hyperspectral reflectance from citrus grown across a gradient of soil drought levels six times, during 20 days of stress induction and 13 days of rewatering. Water stress caused Pn, Cond, and Trmmol rapid and continuous decline throughout the entire drought period. The upper layer was more sensitive to drought than middle and lower layers. Water stress could also bring continuous and dynamic changes of the mean spectral reflectance and absorptance over time. After trees were rewatered, these differences were not obvious. The original reflectance spectra of the four water stresses were surprisingly of low diversity and could not track drought responses, whereas specific hyperspectral spectral vegetation indices (SVIs) and absorption features or wavelength position variables presented great potential. The following machinelearning algorithms: random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), gradient boost (GDboost), and adaptive boosting (Adaboost) were used to develop a measure of photosynthesis from leaf reflectance spectra. The performance of four machine-learning algorithms were assessed, and RF algorithm yielded the highest predictive power for predicting photosynthetic parameters (R2 was 0.92, 0.89, and 0.88 for Pn, Cond, and Trmmol, respectively). Our results indicated that leaf hyperspectral reflectance is a reliable and stable method for monitoring water stress and yield increase, with great potential to be applied in large-scale orchards. © 2021 by the authors.

Considering challenges to quantifying nonlinear ET processes, machine learning (ML) techniques have been increasingly utilized to estimate ET due to their powerful advantage of capturing complex nonlinear structures and characteristics. However, limited studies have been conducted in subhumid climates to simulate local and spatial ETo using common ML methods. The current study aims to present a methodology that exempts local data in ETo simulation. The present study, therefore, seeks to estimate and compare reference ET (ETo) using four common ML methods with local and spatial approaches based on continuous 17-year daily climate data from six weather stations across the Red River Valley with subhumid climate. The four ML models have included Gene Expression Programming (GEP), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multiple Linear Regression (LR), and Random Forest (RF) with three input combinations of maximum and minimum air temperature-based (Tmax, Tmin), mass transfer-based (Tmax, Tmin, U: wind speed), and radiation-based (Rs: solar radiation, Tmax, Tmin) measurements. The estimates yielded by the four ML models were compared against each other by considering spatial and local approaches and four statistical indicators; namely, the root means square error (RMSE), the mean absolute error (MAE), correlation coefficient (r2), and scatter index (SI), which were used to assess the ML model’s performance. The comparison between combinations showed the lowest SI and RMSE values for the RF model with the radiation-based combination. Furthermore, the RF model showed the best performance for all combinations among the four defined models either spatially or locally. In general, the LR, GEP, and SVM models were improved when a local approach was used. The results showed the best performance for the radiation-based combination and the RF model with higher accuracy for all stations either locally or spatially, and the spatial SVM and GEP illustrated the lowest performance among the models and approaches. © 2021 by the authors.

Both estimation and forecasting are based on covariates. However, whereas estimation enables greater agility in current decision making, forecasting can reveal different strategies for the future. The use of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) has brought improvements in accuracy to the estimation and forecasting of agricultural yield for various crops around the world. These models are part of a set of machine-learning models, becoming an important ally not only to producers, companies, cooperatives, and to government institutions for decisions making and strategic decisions at all levels of the agricultural system. The main constraints of agricultural production are climatic conditions and soil water availability during crop cycles. We propose the use of ANNs for soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] yield estimation and forecasting 2 mo before harvesting in the region of MATOPIBA, the largest and the last agricultural frontier of Brazil. This tropical agricultural area has about 73,173,485 hectares, corresponding to approximately 1.3 times the area of France. The input features for ANN were the monthly climatic conditions of air temperature, precipitation, and global radiation, as well as components of the water balance such as crop evapotranspiration, soil water storage, actual evapotranspiration, water deficiency, and surpluses during the cultivation cycle.

There are a wide range of methods for estimation of ET, among which, machine learning techniques and remote sensing-based approaches demonstrated more reasonable results. Accordingly, this study attempts to compare the capability of two developed models of Gene-Expression Programming (GEP) and Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) in estimation of ET, at four different climate types of Temperate-Warm (T-W), Wet-Warm (W-W), Arid-Cold (A-C), and Arid-Warm (A-W). In this way, a-two year of daily records as weather variables (i.e., maximum and minimum temperature, dew-point temperature, vapor pressure, saturated vapor pressure, relative humidity, 24-h rainfall, sunshine hours, and wind speed) were considered as input variables, whereas ET values were computed as output variable (observed ET) by using FAO Penman–Monteith-56 method. After development of two predictive models, the statistical results were compared with well-known Hargreaves–Samani method. The results showed that while Hargreaves–Samani equation could not yield remarkable results in any of the climates, GEP and SEBAL demonstrated accurate predictions. In this way, GEP was the superior model in T-W (R2 = 0.902 and RMSE = 0.713 mm/day) and A-W (R2 = 0.951 and RMSE = 0.634 mm/day) climates but it dropped a bit in two other climates. However, SEBAL not only had the best performance in both climates of W-W (R2 = 0.967 and RMSE = 0.515 mm/day) and A-C (R2 = 0.990 and RMSE = 0.720 mm/day), but also demonstrated good predictions in T-W and A-W climates. Therefore, SEBAL is recommended as the best model for estimation of ET in all climate types. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.",Climate; Conventional-based-equations; Daily evapotranspiration; Gene-expression programming; Meteorological information; Surface energy balance algorithm for land,Evapotranspiration; Gene expression; Hydrostatic pressure; Learning systems; Predictive analytics; Remote sensing; Scheduling; Vapor pressure; Wind; Dewpoint temperature; Gene expression programming; Irrigation scheduling; Machine learning techniques; Maximum and minimum temperatures; Saturated vapor pressure; Surface energy balance algorithm for lands; Water resources management; algorithm; climatology; comparative study; computer simulation; estimation method; evapotranspiration; numerical model; performance assessment; relative humidity; remote sensing; weather forecasting; Climate models,Yes,Yes,"remote sensing, empirical models",climate & meteorology,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

Artificial intelligence algorithms are possibly to learn the soil moisture dynamics in the soil-plant-atmosphere system and then are embedded into a low-cost controller to generate appropriate irrigation schedules. In this study, a neural network (NN) model was proposed to learn from a process-based agricultural systems model, the Root Zone Water Quality Model (RZWQM2) in predicting the root zone soil moisture during the crop growing season. Climatic data, rooting depth and hesternal soil moisture are set as inputs of the NN model to predict intraday soil moisture in different layers. Conditions with and without water supply are modeled separately to achieve a higher accuracy. The NN-based irrigation scheduling method (NN method), triggers irrigation when the predicted soil moisture drops to a level defined by the product of management-allowed depletion multiplied by the depth of available water to plant. Irrigation quantity was set to replenish the root zone soil water content to field capacity. NN method was compared with the reported water stress (WS) method based on RZWQM2. The results reveal that though the constructed NN model well-predicted soil moisture changes during the main crop season with minor errors, but the error was larger at lower soil moisture thereby decreased the scheduling efficiency. An NN ensemble model was tested and shown to improve the precision and robustness of soil moisture prediction as well as the scheduling performance in view of water conservation and yield maintenance. Combined with the NN ensemble model and adjusted lowest soil moisture for triggering irrigations, the NN ensemble-based irrigation scheduling method achieved a performance not better than that of the RZWQM2-WS method but exceeded the method based on evapotranspiration and water balance by up to 20%. The constructed NN ensemble model and NN ensemble-based irrigation scheduling method could act as an alternative to predicting soil moisture and obtaining efficient irrigation scheduling. © 2020",Irrigation scheduling; Multilayer perceptron; Neural network ensemble; RZWQM2; Soil moisture,Agricultural robots; Crops; Cultivation; Forecasting; Irrigation; Moisture control; Neural networks; Real time systems; Scheduling; Soil conservation; Water conservation; Water quality; Water supply; Artificial intelligence algorithms; Irrigation scheduling; Root zone soil moistures; Root Zone Water Quality Model (RZWQM2); Scheduling efficiencies; Scheduling performance; Soil moisture dynamics; Soil moisture predictions; error analysis; evapotranspiration; farming system; field capacity; irrigation; maintenance; performance assessment; real time; rhizosphere; soil moisture; water budget; water stress; Soil moisture,Yes,Yes,Not Specified,"climate & meteorology, soil",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0

In the present study, the accuracy of the Hargreaves method for estimating transpiration evaporation with Adjusted Coefficient K was investigated using artificial neural network model and decision tree model M5. This coefficient is equal to the Hrangav's method of evapotranspiration of the Penman-Monteith FAO model. The climate data used in this research during the period of 2013-2004 was obtained from the Agricultural and Natural Resources Research Center Station and Shahrekord airport in Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari province including minimum temperature, maximum temperature and relative humidity with cold dry climate. To evaluate the performance of the models, two RMSE (mean squared error) and MAE (mean absolute deviation) were calculated. Before using the correction coefficient for the Agricultural Research Station and Natural Resources Research Center, the mean square error of the Hargreaves model was 90.0 RMSE compared to the Penman-Monteith-FAO method, which after using the Adjusted Coefficient using the neural network to RMSE =0.69 and using the Adjusted Coefficient with the decision tree, RMSE = 0.72 For the airport station, before using the correction coefficient root root mean square error RMSE = 0.8852, after using the Adjusted Coefficient for the neural network model RMSE = 0.64 and for the tree model, RMSE = 0.76. In general, the results showed that the Hargreaves model improved after using the Adjusted Coefficient.

This study aims to estimate the amount of ET0 with machine learning approaches by using minimum meteorological parameters in the Corum region, which has an arid and semi-arid climate and is regarded as an important agricultural centre of Turkey. In this context, monthly averages of meteorological variables, i.e. maximum and minimum temperature; sunshine duration; wind speed; and average, maximum, and minimum relative humidity, are used as inputs. Two different kernelbased methods, i.e. Gaussian process regression (GPR) and support vector regression (SVR), together with a Broyden Fletcher Goldfarb Shanno artificial neural network (BFGSANN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) models were used to estimate ET0 amounts in 10 different combinations. The results showed that all four methods predicted ET0 amounts with acceptable accuracy and error levels. The BFGS-ANN model showed higher success (R2 = 0:9781) than the others. In kernel-based GPR and SVR methods, the Pearson VII function-based universal kernel was the most successful (R2 = 0:9771). Scenario 5, with temperatures including average temperature, maximum and minimum temperature, and sunshine duration as inputs, gave the best results. The second best scenario had only the sunshine duration as the input to the BFGS-ANN, which estimated ET0 having a correlation coefficient of 0.971 (Scenario 8). Conclusively, this study shows the better efficacy of the BFGS in ANNs for enhanced performance of the ANN model in ET0 estimation for drought-prone arid and semi-arid regions.  © 2021 Author(s).",,Meleagris gallopavo; Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Evapotranspiration; Learning systems; Long short-term memory; Nonlinear programming; Support vector regression; Water management; Water supply; Wind; Agricultural water management; Arid and semi-arid regions; Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno; Gaussian process regression; Machine learning approaches; Maximum and minimum temperatures; Reference evapotranspiration; Support vector regression (SVR); artificial neural network; comparative study; estimation method; evapotranspiration; machine learning; Deep learning,Yes,Yes,weather station,climate & meteorology,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

In this study, using only temperature data, the performance of three artificial intelligence models and two conventional equations to predict the reference evapotranspiration (ETo) was evaluated in a warm sub-humid climate in México. The artificial intelligence models evaluated were: support vector machines (SVM), Gene Expression Programming (GEP) and XGBoost, and the conventional models were those by Hargreaves-Samani and Camargo. The performance of the models was evaluated according to the statistical indexes: Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Coefficient of Determination (R2) and Mean Bias Error (MBE). Confidence intervals were constructed for each statistical index using the technique of bootstrap resampling with the purpose of evaluating their uncertainty. The results show that among the conventional models evaluated, the equation by Camargo obtained a better performance in the estimation of ETo compared to the equation by Hargreaves. Regarding the artificial intelligence models, the SVM model obtained the best performance among the techniques evaluated. In general, it is recommended to use the SVM model to estimate the ETo values since it outperforms the other techniques. © 2021 Instituto Mexicano de Tecnologia del Agua.

Although the FAO-56 Penman-Monteith (PM) equation is regarded as an ideal model for estimating ETo, its applicability is limited due to the absence of required climatic datasets in many regions of the world. Despite its significance, only a few studies use the EL algorithms for the ETo prediction perspective. In this study, we contribute to fill this gap from a two-fold way. First, we present the potential of new EL Random Tree (RT), Bagging and Random Subspace (RS) algorithms which were compared with two commonly used Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms for predicting daily ETo with the climatic data-limited humid region in Bangladesh during 1983–2017 using a five-fold cross-validation scheme. Second, we explore the role of contributing variables influencing ETo change at the regional scale. When a lack of climatic datasets, Tmax (maximum temperature), Tmin (minimum temperature) and Rs (solar radiation) as 3 input combinations obtained the reasonable precision for estimating ETo in all climatic regions except for south-central and south-western regions. Compared to other state-of-arts models, the RT model performed superior to predict ETo in all input combinations followed by the RF, Bagging, RS, and SVM. Considering less difficulty level, high prediction accuracy, more dependability and fewer computation costs of studied models, RT and RF models have been suggested as the promising potentials for daily ETo estimate in subtropical climate regions of Bangladesh and also may be applicable worldwide in the similar climates. The importance analysis from the RF model depicted that the wind speed (U2) and solar radiation (Rs) are the largest influential variables affecting the observed and predicted daily ETo changes in Bangladesh. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Bagging; Bangladesh; Ensemble model; Random subspace; Random tree; Subtropical humid climate,Bangladesh; Agricultural robots; Climate models; Decision trees; Evapotranspiration; Forecasting; Solar radiation; Support vector machines; Wind; Ensemble learning algorithm; Importance analysis; Minimum temperatures; Penman-Monteith equations; Prediction accuracy; Reference evapotranspiration; Subtropical climates; Support vector machine algorithm; algorithm; evapotranspiration; Penman-Monteith equation; prediction; solar radiation; spatiotemporal analysis; subtropical region; support vector machine; Learning algorithms,Yes,Yes,empirical models,"climate & meteorology, vegetation indices",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0

For the best irrigation management, it is necessary to know the potential evapotranspiration rate for water control in order to increase productivity. There are several direct and indirect methods for estimating evapotranspiration, but the standard method recommended by the United Nations Agriculture Organization (FAO) is the Penman-Monteith (PETpm) method because it has higher accuracy than other methods. However, it is a difficult method to be used due to the need for a large number of meteorological elements. In this con-text, the objective of this study was to estimate potential evapotranspiration by the Penman-Monteith method in the micro-region of Baixo Parnaíba in Maranhão state using artificial neural networks. Agro-meteorological data were col-lected daily over 34 years, from 1984 to 2017, and these data were obtained from the NASA/POWER website. Subse-quently, liquid radiation and potential evapotranspiration were calculated by the Penman-Monteith standard method (1998). To predict potential daily evapotranspiration, the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) was chosen, which is a tradi-tional Artificial Neural Network. The period that presented a higher evapotranspiration index was the same one that showed precipitation with a lower volume and higher temperatures. The artificial neural network model that best adap-ted to estimate PETpm was MLP 2-5-1. It is concluded that artificial neural networks estimate with accuracy and preci-sion the Penman-Monteith daily potential evapotranspiration of the Lower Parnaiba in Maranhão, and potential evapotranspiration can be estimated by the Penman-Monteith method using neural networks with inputs of air tempera-tures. © 2020, Sociedade Brasileira de Meteorologia.

Therefore, the objective of this study was to predict the water management parameters with vegetation indices (VIs) and regression algorithms to enable irrigation management in a totally remote manner. The study was carried out in commercial maize areas irrigated by central pivots in the western part of the state of Bahia, Brazil. The MOD09GQ product was used to generate input data for the training models and to understand the phenology variations in the crops. The prediction of the dependent variables was tested using six regression algorithms, and the best algorithm was selected based on five statistical metrics. Among the regression models tested, the three that best fit the ETa and SWC data were RF (random forest), cubist (cubist regression), and GBM (gradient boosting machine), with slight superiority of cubist for the ETa and RF for the SWC. The fitted models for ETa and SWC showed the potential of VIs in providing information for irrigated agriculture and reinforcing the ability of regression algorithms in modelling the SWC and ETa variables. The findings make it possible to monitor irrigation efficiently with only the red and near infrared wavelengths, a fact that is considered the main contribution of this research to the practical and scientific communities. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Decision-making; Irrigation management; Machine learning; Remote sensing; Vegetation indices,Bahia; Brazil; Zea mays; Agricultural robots; Decision trees; Evapotranspiration; Forecasting; Forestry; Infrared devices; Irrigation; Logistic regression; Parameter estimation; Soil moisture; Tantalum compounds; Water management; Actual evapotranspiration; Dependent variables; Irrigated agriculture; Irrigation management; Near-infrared wavelength; Regression algorithms; Remote sensing data; Scientific community; algorithm; evapotranspiration; maize; phenology; regression analysis; remote sensing; satellite data; soil water; Remote sensing,Yes,Yes,remote sensing,"climate & meteorology, vegetation indices",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0

A major issue with applying those models is the proper selection of training/testing data sets. Although some spatial generalization approaches have been recommended for this purpose, there are no specified recommended local (temporal) data partitioning strategies for machine learning based ETo estimation. The present study evaluates different hold-out and k-fold validation temporal data partitioning strategies when using gene expression programming (GEP) technique to estimate daily ETo in arid regions. The k-fold validation strategies considered annual, monthly and growing season period patterns as test data sets. Although commonly used partitioning of the available patterns into training and testing sets gave accurate results, statistical analysis showed that the results obtained through k-fold validation assessment were more reliable. A two-block partitioning strategy with chronologic data selection for training and testing provided the most accurate results among the hold-out procedures (mean scatter index (SI) value of 0.162). Fixing the extreme ETo values as training data set in hold-out procedures provided the less accurate results with considerable over/underestimation of the ETo values (mean SI value was 0.506). Results on the basis of hold-out approaches can be biased or only partially valid depending on selection of the test data from the time series. K-fold validation yielded the lowest over/underestimations of ETo values. Further, considering monthly patterns as minimum affordable test size produced higher error magnitudes among k-fold validation strategies, while considering the complete patterns of one growing season provided more accurate results among k-fold validation strategies. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Evapotranspiration; Gene expression programming; Hold out; K-fold validation,Arid regions; Evapotranspiration; Gene expression; Machine learning; Climatic conditions; Data partitioning strategies; Gene expression programming; Machine learning techniques; Reference evapotranspiration; Training and testing; Validation assessment; Validation strategies; arid region; climate conditions; data set; estimation method; evapotranspiration; growing season; machine learning; model validation; Data handling,Yes,Yes,Not Specified,"climate & meteorology, vegetation indices",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0

Previous studies suggested that the calibration-free complementary relationship (CR) method that requires only routine meteorological data performed better than main-stream atmospheric reanalyses, land surface or remote sensing models in estimating large-scale ET. Here we simultaneously evaluate the latest machine learning-based upscaling of eddy-covariance measurements (FLUXCOM) and the CR estimates against the water-balance derived ET rates of 18 large Hydrologic Unit Code-2 (HUC2) and 327 medium HUC6 basins across the conterminous United States. Overall, CR and FLUXCOM perform comparably in representing the multiyear mean and temporal variations in annual ET at both, HUC2 and HUC6, scales for the 1979–2013 period. Such equally good skills also hold true for the 2003–2015 period, during which FLUXCOM was driven solely by remote sensing data. However, the CR generally captures the long-term linear tendencies in annual ET rates somewhat better than FLUXCOM. Because of its minimal data requirement, the calibration-free version of the CR may continue to serve as a benchmarking tool for large-scale ET simulations. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Benchmarking; Complementary relationship; FLUXCOM; Large-scale evapotranspiration; Water balance,United States; Benchmarking; Calibration; Data streams; Evapotranspiration; Meteorology; Benchmarking tools; Complementary relationship; Eddy covariance measurements; Meteorological data; Remote sensing data; Remote sensing models; Temporal variation; Terrestrial evapotranspiration; benchmarking; calibration; complementarity; eddy covariance; estimation method; evapotranspiration; long-term change; machine learning; numerical model; parameterization; remote sensing; satellite data; simulation; Remote sensing,Yes,Yes,"weather station, remote sensing","climate & meteorology, vegetation indices",0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0

This study focuses on the prediction of the temporal aspect of the two drought indices (standardized precipitation index - SPI and standardized precipitation-evapotranspiration index - SPEI) using six hydro-climatic variables relating to the period 1979-2013. The model SVR3-SPI: RBF, ε = 0.004, C = 20 and γ = 1.7 for the index SPI, and the model SVR3-SPEI: RBF ε = 0.004, C = 40 and γ = 0.167 for the SPEI index are significantly better in comparison to other models SVR1, SVR2 and SVR4. The SVR model for the SPI index gave a correlation coefficient of R = 0.92, MSE = 0.17 and MAE = 0.329 for the learning phase and R = 0.90, MSE = 0.18 and MAE = 0.313 for the testing phase. As for the SPEI index, the overlay is slightly poorer only in the case of the SPI index between the observed values and the predicted ones by the SVR model. It shows a very small gap between the observed and predicted values. The correlation coefficients R = 0.88 for the learning, R = 0.86 for testing remain higher and corresponding to a quadratic error average MSE = 0.21 and MAE = 0.351 for the learning and MSE = 0.21 and MAE = 0.350 for the testing phase. The prediction of drought by SVR model remain useful and would be extremely important for drought risk management. © 2021.

The modeling of the daily and monthly solar radiation by Gaussian process regression (GPR) with K-fold cross-validation model has been discussed recently. This study evaluated different neural models such as artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM), adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), and multiple linear regression (MLR) for estimating the global solar radiation (daily and monthly) with K-fold cross-validation method. For the appropriate comparison of the models, the randomized complete block (RCB) design applied in the training and test phases. Also, different data sets were evaluated by K-fold cross-validation in each model. The results showed that radial basis function (RBF) model has the lowest error for estimating the monthly and daily solar radiation. In this study, the result of RBF was compared with the GPR models. The conclusion indicated that RBF methodology can predict solar radiation with higher accuracy relative to the GPR model. The results of yearly solar radiation estimation (2009–2014) showed that the RBF model can estimate solar radiation with the MAPE and RMSE of 5.1% and 0.29, respectively. Also, the coefficient of correlation (R2) between actual and estimated values throughout the year is 98% and can be used by the engineers and other researchers for solar and thermal applications. © 2021, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.",Global solar radiation; Modeling; Radial bias function; Support vector machine,artificial neural network; machine learning; modeling; multiple regression; numerical model; solar radiation; support vector machine,Yes,Yes,remote sensing,climate & meteorology,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

To better understand the changing characteristics of Lake Hulun and the driving mechanisms, it is necessary to investigate the water storage changes of Lake Hulun on extended timescales. The main objective of this study is to reconstruct the water storage time series of Lake Hulun over the past century. We employed a machine learning approach termed the extreme gradient boosting tree (XGBoost) to reconstruct the water storage changes over a one-century timescale based on the generated bathymetry and satellite altimetry data and investigated the relationships with hydrological and climatic variables in long term. Results show that the water storage changes from 1961 to 2019 were featured by four fluctuation phases, with the highest water storage observed in 1991 (14.02 Gt) and the lowest point in 2012 (5.18 Gt). The century-scale reconstruction result reveals that the water storage of Lake Hulun reached the highest point in the 1960s within the period of 1910–2019. The lowest stage occurred in the sub-period of the 1930s–1940s, which was even lower than the alerted shrinkage stage in 2012. The predictive model results indicate the effective performance of the XGBoost model in reconstructing century-scale water storage variations, with the mean absolute error of 0.68, normalized root mean square error of 0.11, Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency of 0.97, and correlation coefficient of 0.94. The annual fluctuations of water storage were mostly affected by precipitation, followed by vapor pressure, temperature, potential evapotranspiration, and wet day frequency. The dominating characteristics of different variables vary evidently with different sub-periods. The atmospheric circulations of the Arctic Oscillation, El Nino Southern Oscillation, Pacific Decadal Oscillation, and North Atlantic Oscillation have tight associations with the water storage variations of Lake Hulun, which change with different study periods. © 2021.

1333,Kelley J.,Assessment and correction of solar radiation measurements with simple neural networks,2020,10.3390/atmos11111160,"Solar radiation received at the Earth’s surface provides the energy driving all micrometeorological phenomena. Local solar radiation measurements are used to estimate energy mediated processes such as evapotranspiration (ET); this information is important in managing natural resources. However, the technical requirements to reliably measure solar radiation limits more extensive adoption of data‐driven management. High‐quality radiation sensors are expensive, delicate, and require skill to maintain. In contrast, low‐cost sensors are widely available, but may lack long‐term reliability and intra‐sensor repeatability. As weather stations measure solar radiation and other parameters simultaneously, machine learning can be used to integrate various types of environmental data, identify periods of erroneous measurements, and estimate corrected values. We demonstrate two case studies in which we use neural networks (NN) to augment direct radiation measurements with data from co‐located sensors, and generate radiation estimates with comparable accuracy to the data typically available from agro‐meteorology networks. NN models that incorporated radiometer data reproduced measured radiation with an R2 of 0.9–0.98, and RMSE less than 100 Wm−2, while models using only weather parameters obtained R2 less than 0.75 and RMSE greater than 140 Wm−2. These cases show that a simple NN implementation can complement standard procedures for estimating solar radiation, create opportunities to measure radiation at low‐cost, and foster adoption of data‐driven management. © 2020 by the author.

The reference evapotranspiration (ET0 ) is particularly important in the croplands because it is a convenient and reasonable method for calculating the actual evapotranspiration (AET) that represents the loss of water in the croplands through the soil evaporation and vegetation transpiration. To date, many efforts have been made to retrieve ET0 on a spatially continuous grid. In particular, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) product is provided with a reasonable spatial resolution of 500 m and a temporal resolution of 8 days. However, the applicability to the local-scale variabilities due to complex and heterogeneous land surfaces in countries like South Korea is not sufficiently validated. Meanwhile, the AI approaches showed a useful functionality for the ET0 retrieval on the local scale but have rarely demonstrated a substantial product for a spatially continuous grid. This paper presented a retrieval of the daily reference evapotranspiration (ET0 ) over a 500 m grid for croplands in South Korea using machine learning (ML) with satellite images and numerical weather prediction data. In a blind test for 2013–2019, the ML-based ET0 model produced the accuracy statistics with a root mean square error of 1.038 mm/day and a correlation coefficient of 0.870. The results of the blind test were stable irrespective of location, year, and month. This outcome is presumably because the input data of the ML-based ET0 model were suitably arranged spatially and temporally, and the optimization of the model was appropriate. We found that the relative humidity and land surface temperature were the most influential variables for the ML-based ET0 model, but the variables with lower importance were also necessary to consider the nonlinearity between the variables. Using the daily ET0 data produced over the 500 m grid, we conducted a case study to examine agrometeorological characteristics of the croplands in South Korea during the period when heatwave and drought events occurred. Through the experiments, the feasibility of the ML-based ET0 retrieval was validated, especially for local agrometeorological applications in regions with heterogeneous land surfaces, such as South Korea. © 2020 by the authors.

However, caused by the insufficient meteorological data and indefinite input combination, uncertainties may exist in the simplified artificial intelligence (AI) models. Thus, determination the uncertainty is significant for accurate ET0 results. In this study, the validity of 29 combination scenarios of maximum and minimum temperature, wind speed, relative humidity, solar radiation, sunshine duration, and atmospheric pressure was examined by applying the artificial neural network (ANN), support vector regression (SVR), and extreme learning machine (ELM) models for the arid Altay Prefecture. Performances of the models were evaluated against the Penman-Monteith equation by coefficient of correlation (R), root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NS) in testing period. The Monte Carlo (MC) technique was firstly performed to analyze the sensitivity of the meteorological parameters and the uncertainty of the AI models. The results confirmed the indispensable role of temperature and the predominant function of the aerodynamic part in evapotranspiration process. An input pattern, which is able to reveal the physical mechanism of AI models in ET0 estimation, was proposed innovatively. Both the SVR and ELM models are highly recommended for ET0 estimation due to the comparable simulating ability and lower uncertainty. The findings help to understand the implied intrinsic mechanism of evapotranspiration in AI models and can be regarded as a breakthrough in ET0 modeling. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Artificial Intelligence; Monte Carlo simulation; Reference evapotranspiration (ET<sub>0</sub>); Uncertainty analysis,Altay [Xinjiang Uygur]; China; Xinjiang Uygur; Artificial intelligence; Atmospheric humidity; Atmospheric pressure; Evapotranspiration; Learning systems; Mean square error; Meteorology; Monte Carlo methods; Support vector regression; Water management; Wind; Coefficient of correlation; Extreme learning machine; Maximum and minimum temperatures; Meteorological parameters; Penman-Monteith equations; Reference evapotranspiration; Support vector regression (SVR); Waterresource management; accuracy assessment; artificial intelligence; atmospheric pressure; estimation method; evapotranspiration; global change; high temperature; low temperature; relative humidity; solar radiation; uncertainty analysis; water resource; wind velocity; Uncertainty analysis,Yes,Yes,"weather station, empirical models","climate & meteorology, vegetation indices",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0

Accurate estimation of ETo is valuable for various applications of water resource engineering, especially in developing countries such as Iran, which has no advanced meteorological stations and lacks facilities and information. Also, due to the existence of different climates in Iran, the estimate of ETo has become a challenge. To this end, the aim of this study is to estimate the ETo to eliminate the two limitations of the absence of a comprehensive model for all climates and the scarcity of meteorological information in Iran. The present study investigates the ability of the hybrid artificial neural network- Gray Wolf Optimization (ANN-GWO) model to estimate ETo for Iran.

The development of models is based on meteorological data of Iran's 31 provinces consists of 5 different climates. Based on empirical equations and least inputs, seven different input scenarios were introduced and Penman-Monteith reference evapotranspiration was considered as the output of the models.

The results showed that the GWO algorithm acted as an efficient tool in optimizing the structure of the ANN and the ANN-GWO model was more accurate than ANN and LS-SVR in all scenarios. ANN-GWO6 with inputs of wind speed, maximum and minimum temperatures, had the lowest error and decreased in terms of SI index by 42% (compared to ANN6) and 30% (compared to LS-SVR6). Furthermore, based on GPI, it is in the first place with a 99% reduction, compared to ANN6 and LS-SVR6. The hybrid approach used in this study can be developed as a trustful expert intelligent system for estimating ETo in Iran. © 2020",Artificial Neural Network; Grey Wolf Optimization; Hybrid Model; Least square support vector regression; Reference evapotranspiration; Shannon Entropy,Iran; Canis lupus; Agricultural robots; Developing countries; Evapotranspiration; Intelligent systems; Meteorology; Neural networks; Support vector regression; Wind; Agricultural management; Hybrid artificial neural network; Least square support vector regressions; Maximum and minimum temperatures; Meteorological information; Reference evapotranspiration; Statistical indicators; Water resources planning; agricultural management; artificial intelligence; artificial neural network; evapotranspiration; hydrological cycle; Penman-Monteith equation; performance assessment; temperature profile; wind velocity; Climate models,Yes,Yes,"weather station, empirical models",climate & meteorology,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

Based on the data of daily meteorological elements such as temperature, wind speed, and relative humidity at 5 meteorological stations in Shiyang River Basin for five years, the Penman-Monteith formula is used to calculate ET0 in Shiyang River Basin. Six-factor, four-factor, and three-factor support vector machine model (SVM) and artificial neural network model (ANN) are established to simulate the daily ET0, and then the simulated values are compared with the calculated values. Root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), deterministic coefficient (DC), and Pearson correlation coefficient (R) are used as the performance evaluation index of the models, and the models are tested to obtain models with higher simulation accuracy. The results show that under the same factor input, the ANN model has higher simulation accuracy than the SVM model in Shiyang River Basin to simulate daily ET0.

Over the past few decades, a natural disaster has accelerated its occurrence, which has significantly impacted agricultural systems, economies, environments, water resources, and supplies. Therefore, it is essential to develop new techniques that enable comprehensive determination and observations of droughts over large areas with satisfactory spatial and temporal resolution. This study modeled a new drought index called the Combined Terrestrial Evapotranspiration Index (CTEI), developed in the Ganga river basin. For this, five Machine Learning (ML) techniques, derived from artificial intelligence theories, were applied: The Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm, decision trees, Matern 5/2 Gaussian process regression, boosted trees, and bagged trees. These techniques were driven by twelve different models generated from input combinations of satellite data and hydrometeorological parameters. The results indicated that the eighth model performed best and was superior among all the models, with the SVM algorithm resulting in an R2 value of 0.82 and the lowest errors in terms of the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) (0.33) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) (0.20), followed by the Matern 5/2 Gaussian model with an R2 value of 0.75 and RMSE and MAE of 0.39 and 0.21 mm/day, respectively. Moreover, among all the five methods, the SVM and Matern 5/2 Gaussian methods were the best-performing ML algorithms in our study of CTEI predictions for the Ganga basin. © 2021 by the authors.

The Penman-Monteith equation is known for its accuracy but requires a high number of climatic parameters that are not always available. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the performance of machine learning techniques (cubist regression, artificial neural network with Bayesian regularization, support vector machine with linear kernel function) and stepwise multiple linear regression method to estimate daily ET0 with limited weather data in a Brazilian agricultural frontier (MATOPIBA). Climatic data from 2000 to 2016 obtained from 23 weather stations were used. Five data scenarios were evaluated: (i) all variables, (ii) radiation and temperature, (iii) temperature and relative humidity, (iv) wind speed and temperature, and (v) temperature. The results showed that the machine learning methods are robust in estimating ET0, even in the absence of some variables. Among the methods evaluated using only temperature data, the cubist regression showed better performance. When estimating water demand for soybean and maize crops using only temperature, the cubist regression and calibrated Hargreaves-Samani equation showed the smallest errors. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.",,Brazil; Glycine max; Zea mays; agricultural development; estimation method; evapotranspiration; irrigation; machine learning; numerical model; water management; water resource,Yes,Yes,"weather station, empirical models",climate & meteorology,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

Fast, non-destructive, and accurate monitoring of the winter wheat LAI during the critical growth period is an important way to accurately grasp crop canopy structure, growth information, above-ground biomass, yield, and pests. In the past, most of the estimated data of LAI were inverted by ground spectrum, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) multi-spectrum, and satellite multi-spectral remote sensing data. In this study, a low-altitude unmanned aerial vehicle platform and an imaging spectrometer were used to obtain hyperspectral remote sensing images of jointing winter wheat in Xianyang city, Shaanxi province, China. The first derivative and continuous spectrum removal spectrum were used to transform the original canopy spectrum at 450-950 nm to extract any two frequency bands Specific. The Ratio Spectral Index (RSI), Differential Spectral Index (DSI), and Normalized Spectral Index (NDSI) were constructed respectively. Combining a narrow-band spectral index, a univariate regression analysis was performed on the best nine narrow-band spectral indices of a class, the original canopy spectrum, the first derivative spectrum, and the three best combinations spectra of any two bands under the continuous spectrum removal spectrum. The index was modeled using multiple linear regression. Two machine learning algorithms (BP neural network and random forest) were used to model a total of nine best narrowband spectral indices under three transformations. By comparing the coefficient of determination, the root mean square error, and the residual prediction deviation, the best estimation model of winter LAI was selected. The results showed that spectral transformation significantly improved the correlation between spectral variables and LAI, and the position with a higher correlation was mainly located in the red edge area. The correlation between the optimal narrow-band spectral index extracted based on the first derivative transform spectrum and the continuous spectrum removal transform spectrum and LAI was nonlinear, which was more suitable for fitting a quadratic function of a variable. Compared with the unary regression model, the accuracy of the multiple linear regression model based on the multi-spectral index was not significantly improved. However, both the multiple regression model and the unary linear regression model showed that the accuracy of the model based on the continuous spectrum transformation spectrum was higher than the accuracy of the model under the original spectrum and the first derivative transformation spectrum. It showed that the continuum removal method was used to transform the spectrum and used for modeling, and the NDSI (738, 822) index based on the continuous removal spectrum had a good LAI estimation ability. Compared with the traditional regression model, the accuracy of the BP neural network model and the random forest regression model constructed with the 9 best narrowband spectral indices as independent variables had been significantly improved. Among them, the random forest regression model had the highest accuracy, because the random forest algorithm modeling could well tolerate some noise and outliers. As long as the parameters were adjusted accurately, overfitting was less likely to occur, and it was more suitable to solve certain nonlinear problems. Based on this model, the spatial distribution of the LAI of winter wheat at the jointing stage in this study area was basically in line with the actual situation, and the LAI estimation accuracy based on the narrow-band spectral index, and random forest algorithm was the highest (the residual prediction deviation was 2.01, the coefficient of determination was 0.77, the root mean square error was 0.27), which could be used as a basic model for hyperspectral remote sensing estimation of winter wheat UAV at jointing stage. The basic model could realize the LAI remote sensing mapping of a small area. It could provide a theoretical basis for later crop growth and variable fertilization. © 2020, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

Widely used methods for its assessment comprise sap flux techniques for whole-plant transpiration and porometry for leaf stomatal conductance. Recently emerging approaches based on surface temperatures and a wide range of machine learning techniques offer new possibilities to quantify transpiration. The focus of this study was to predict sap flux and leaf stomatal conductance based on drone-recorded and meteorological data and compare these predictions with in-situ measured transpiration. To build the prediction models, we applied classical statistical approaches and machine learning algorithms. The field work was conducted in an oil palm agroforest in lowland Sumatra. Random forest predictions yielded the highest congruence with measured sap flux (r2 = 0.87 for trees and r2 = 0.58 for palms) and confidence intervals for intercept and slope of a Passing-Bablok regression suggest interchangeability of the methods. Differences in model performance are indicated when predicting different tree species. Predictions for stomatal conductance were less congruent for all prediction methods, likely due to spatial and temporal offsets of the measurements. Overall, the applied drone and modelling scheme predicts whole-plant transpiration with high accuracy. We conclude that there is large potential in machine learning approaches for ecological applications such as predicting transpiration. © 2020 by the authors.

Typically, irrigation plans are generated through the use of mathematical models. However, the unwelcoming fact is that such models usually require a massive quantity of monitored data that is often unavailable or incomplete in most developing countries. As a consequence, this paper takes advantage of advanced artificial intelligence techniques, in particular, the case-based reasoning approach, to estimate the reference evapotranspiration, and therefore, to calculate the amount of irrigation water in grape farming. For improving the current case-based reasoning approach, especially the solution revision part, this paper proposes a learning-based adaptation strategy by fully making use of the hidden information in the case base. Inspired by the feature vector representation, a revision task could be also considered as a situation and action pair. The situation part attempts to capture the difference between the target case and past cases, while the action pair aims at adapting the solution to reflect the detected difference by learning adaptation knowledge from past experiences. Two retrieval tasks are involved in the revision process. On the one hand, the first one tries to retrieve an adaptation case and evaluate the difference between the new case. On the other hand, the second retrieval task should identify a collection of past cases that shares the similar difference as detected before. By learning from how the solutions of retrieved past cases were updated to solve the adaptation case, the solution of the adaptation case can be revised accordingly based on the obtained adaptation knowledge, and therefore to solve the new case. The experiment focuses on verifying the effectiveness of the case-based reasoning approach in irrigation scheduling, and evaluating the accuracy of the learning-based adaptation strategy. The experimental results demonstrate that the system is able to output a reasonable irrigation plan, while the deviation between the predicted and recorded values is around 5.42% and 7.94% for the relevance evapotranspiration and the amount of irrigation water respectively. In conclusion, the proposal in this paper has great potential for modeling irrigation scheduling system with promising advantages. © 2020",Case-based reasoning; Decision support; Grape farming; Irrigation scheduling; Revision,Vitaceae; Developing countries; Evapotranspiration; Irrigation; Scheduling; Water supply; Adaptation knowledge; Adaptation strategies; Artificial intelligence techniques; Case-based reasoning approaches; Irrigation scheduling; Massive quantities; Reference evapotranspiration; Vineyard management; algorithm; developing world; farming system; irrigation system; strategic approach; vine; vineyard; Case based reasoning,Yes,Yes,Not Specified,"climate & meteorology, vegetation indices",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0

This study evaluated the potential of a newly proposed artificial intelligence (i.e., DeepFM) and three newly developed gradient boosting models (i.e., CatBoost, LightGBM, and XGBoost) for estimating daily ETo using limited meteorological parameters in contrasting climates of China. The three commonly used tree-based models (i.e., GBDT, RF, and ET) and one kernel-based model (i.e., SVM-RBF) were also assessed for comparison. Eight various input combinations of meteorological parameters (temperature, humidity, wind speed, and sunshine duration) from twelve stations during 1961–2016 in contrasting climates of China were employed for model training and testing. The results showed that all models (except ET) could obtain satisfactory prediction accuracy (R2 ≥ 0.9906, RMSE ≤ 0.1773 mm d-1, and MAE ≤ 0.1226 mm d-1) for ETo estimation in contrasting climates of China when complete meteorological parameters were input. Moreover, all models can be sorted from the best to the poorest as follows based on the model accuracy: CatBoost > LightGBM > XGboost > GBDT > SVM-RBF > DeepFM > RF > ET; regarding their stability, the eight algorithms can be ranked from the best to the poorest as follows: ET > SVM-RBF > DeepFM > CatBoost > XGboost > GBDT > LightGBM > RF. Therefore, considering the prediction accuracy and model stability comprehensively, the CatBoost and LightGBM models were highly recommended for predicting daily ETo in this study. The XGBoost and GBDT models were promising alternative models for estimating daily ETo. The DeepFM model also had the potential to estimating daily ETo under single variable combinations. The sunshine duration played a more important role than temperature, humidity, and wind speed in estimating ETo, and it was a promising alternative parameter under the circumstances of lacking global radiation observation. © 2021, Saudi Society for Geosciences.",Deep factorization machine; Gradient boosting models; Model stability; Prediction accuracy; Reference evapotranspiration,China; environmental factor; evapotranspiration; meteorology; model; modeling,Yes,Yes,weather station,climate & meteorology,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Therefore, this study assesses the potential of deep learning (long short-term memory (LSTM), one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D CNN) and a combination of the two previous models (CNN-LSTM)) and traditional machine learning models (artificial neural network (ANN) and random forest (RF)), in regional and local scenarios, to forecast multi-step ahead daily ETo (seven days) using iterated, direct and multiple input multiple output (MIMO) forecasting strategies. Three input data combinations were assessed: (1) only lagged ETo; (2) lagged ETo + day of the year of each step of the time lag considered; and (3) the same of input combination 2 + lagged meteorological variables. Data from 53 weather stations located in Minas Gerais, Brazil, were used. Four stations were used as test stations. Two baselines were also employed: (B1), all the forecasting horizon is considered equal to the mean ETo measured during the last seven days; and (B2), ahead ETo values are considered equal to their respective historical monthly means. In general, MIMO was the best forecasting strategy, offering good performance and lower computational cost. The deep learning models performed slightly better than the machine learning models, and both were better than the best baseline (B2), mainly on the first and second forecasting days. Among the deep learning models, CNN-LSTM2 (i.e., CNN-LSTM with input combination 2) performed the best in local scenario (mean RMSE over the prediction horizon and stations equal to 0.87), and CNN-LSTM3 performed the best in regional scenario (mean RMSE equal to 0.88). The regional models are recommended instead of the local models since they exhibited similar performances and have higher generalization capacity. Finally, although the models developed have not exhibited high accuracies, they can be useful tools in places where historical monthly mean ETo is used to forecast ETo. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Long short-term memory; Machine learning; One-dimensional convolutional neural network; Time series,"Brazil; Minas Gerais; Convolutional neural networks; Decision trees; Evapotranspiration; Forecasting; Learning systems; Long short-term memory; MIMO systems; One dimensional; Computational costs; Generalization capacity; Irrigation planning; Machine learning models; Meteorological variables; Minas Gerais , Brazil; Prediction horizon; Reference evapotranspiration; baseline survey; diurnal variation; evapotranspiration; irrigation system; machine learning; meteorology; prediction; scenario analysis; Deep learning",Yes,Yes,weather station,"climate & meteorology, vegetation indices",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0

While analyses of temporal and spatial patterns of FLS in Europe exist, the interactions between FLS determinants underlying them have not been studied explicitly and quantitatively at a continental scale yet. In this study, a state-of-the-art machine learning technique is applied to model FLS occurrence over continental Europe, using meteorological and land surface parameters from geostationary satellite and reanalysis data. Spatially explicit model units are created to test for spatial and seasonal differences in model performance and FLS sensitivities to changes in predictors, and effects of different data preprocessing procedures are evaluated. The statistical models show good performance in predicting FLS occurrence during validation, with R2>0.9 especially in winter high pressure situations.The predictive skill of the models seems to be dependent on data availability, data preprocessing, time period, and geographic characteristics. It is shown that atmospheric proxies are more important determinants of FLS presence than surface characteristics, in particular mean sea level pressure, near-surface wind speed and evapotranspiration are crucial, together with FLS occurrence on the previous day. Higher wind speeds, higher land surface temperatures and higher evapotranspiration tend to be negatively related to FLS. Spatial patterns of feature importance show the dominant influence of mean sea level pressure on FLS occurrence throughout the central European domain. When only high pressure situations are considered, wind speed (in the western study region) and evapotranspiration (in the eastern study region) gain importance, highlighting the influence of moisture advection on FLS occurrence in the western parts of the central European domain. This study shows that FLS occurrence can be accurately modeled using machine learning techniques in large spatial domains based on meteorological and land surface predictors. The statistical models used in this study provide a novel analysis tool for investigating empirical relationships in the FLS – land surface system and possibly infer processes. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Atmosphere-land surface interactions; Europe; Fog; Land surface; Low stratus; Machine learning,Europe; Clouds; Evapotranspiration; Geostationary satellites; High pressure effects; Machine learning; Sea level; Surface measurement; Wind; Empirical relationships; Geographic characteristics; Land surface conditions; Land surface parameters; Machine learning techniques; Mean sea level pressures; Spatially explicit modeling; Temporal and spatial pattern; advection; data assimilation; evapotranspiration; fog; geostationary satellite; high pressure; land surface; machine learning; qualitative analysis; sea level pressure; wind velocity; Land surface temperature,Yes,Yes,"weather station, remote sensing","climate & meteorology, vegetation indices",0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0

We compared accuracy with empirical model for estimating the reference evapotranspiration.Result:The meteorological factors that impacted the accuracy of the machine learning model for estimating ET0 was ranked in the descending order as follows based on their significance: Rs>Tmax>Tmin>RH>U2. Models using Tmax, Tmin, Rs and U2 gave the most accurate ET0 estimate with RMSE<0.2 mm/d.

In this study, the snow cover of the northern and southern slopes of Alborz Mountains in Iran was investigated by considering two issues: (1) Estimating the snow cover area and the (2) effects of droughts on snow cover. The snow cover data were monitored by images obtained from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor. The meteorological data (including the precipitation, minimum and maximum temperature, global solar radiation, relative humidity, and wind velocity) were prepared by a combination of National Centers for Environmental Prediction‐Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (NCEP‐CFSR) points and meteorological stations. The data scale was monthly and belonged to the 2000–2014 period. In the first part of the study, snow cover estimation was conducted by Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), Least Square Support Vector Machine (LSSVM), Group Method of Data Handling (GMDH), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), and MLP with Grey Wolf Optimization (MLP‐ GWO) models. The most accurate estimations were produced by the MLP‐GWO and GMDH models. The models produced better snow cover estimations for the northern slope compared to the southern slope. The GWO improved the MLP’s accuracy by 10.7%. In the second part, seven drought indices, including the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), Bahlme–Mooley Drought Index (BMDI), Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), Multivariate Standardized Precipitation Index (MSPI), Modified Standardized Precipitation Index (SPImod), Joint Deficit Index (JDI), and Standardized Precipitation‐Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) were calculated for both slopes. The results showed that the effects of a drought event on the snow cover area would remain up to 5 (or 6) months in the region. The highest impact of drought appears after two months in the snow cover area, and the drought index most related to snow cover variations is the 2–month time window of SPI (SPI2). The results of both subjects were promising and the methods can be examined in other snowy areas of the world. © 2020 by the authors.

Besides, using pan evaporation estimating models and pan coefficient (kp) models is a classic method to assess the reference evapotranspiration (ET0 ) which is indispensable to crop growth, irrigation scheduling, and economic assessment. This study estimated the potential of a novel hybrid machine learning model Coupling Bat algorithm (Bat) and Gradient boosting with categorical features support (CatBoost) for estimating daily pan evaporation in arid and semi-arid regions of northwest China. Two other commonly used algorithms including random forest (RF) and original CatBoost (CB) were also applied for comparison. The daily meteorological data for 12 years (2006–2017) from 45 weather stations in arid and semi-arid areas of China, including minimum and maximum air temperature (Tmin, Tmax ), relative humidity (RH), wind speed (U), and global solar radiation (Rs ), were utilized to feed the three models for exploring the ability in predicting pan evaporation. The results revealed that the new developed Bat-CB model (RMSE = 0.859–2.227 mm·d−1; MAE = 0.540–1.328 mm·d−1; NSE = 0.625–0.894; MAPE = 0.162–0.328) was superior to RF and CB. In addition, CB (RMSE = 0.897–2.754 mm·d−1; MAE = 0.531–1.77 mm·d−1; NSE = 0.147–0.869; MAPE = 0.161–0.421) slightly outperformed RF (RMSE = 1.005–3.604 mm·d−1; MAE = 0.644–2.479 mm·d−1; NSE = −1.242–0.894; MAPE = 0.176–0.686) which had poor ability to operate the erratic changes of pan evaporation. Furthermore, the improvement of Bat-CB was presented more comprehensively and obviously in the seasonal and spatial performance compared to CB and RF.

The aim of this study is to present a methodology for evaluating the robustness of regression coefficients associated to climate parameters (RH, u2, and T) in pan method models during recalibration at local conditions. Two years of daily data from April to October (warm season) of meteorological parameters, Epan measurements from class A pan evaporimeter and ETo estimated by ASCE-standardized method for the climatic conditions of Thessaloniki (Greece, semi-arid environment), were used. The regression coefficients of six general nonlinear (NLR) regression Epan models were analyzed through recalibration using a technique called “random cross-validation nonlinear regression RCV-NLR” that produced 1000 random splits of the initial dataset into calibration and validation sets using a constant proportion (70% and 30%, respectively). The variance of the regression coefficients was analyzed based on the 95% interval of the highest posterior density distribution. NLR models that included coefficients with a 95% HPD interval that fluctuates in both positive and negative values were considered nonrobust. The machine-learning technique of random forests (RF) was also used to build a RF model that includes Epan, u2, RH, and T parameters. This model was used as a benchmark for evaluating the predictive accuracy of NLR models but, also, for assessing the relative importance of the predictor climate variables if they were all included in one NLR model. The findings of this study indicated that locally calibrated NLR functions that use only the Epan parameter presented better results, while the inclusion of additional climate parameters was redundant and led to underfitting. © 2020 by the authors.

FAO-56 Penman-Monteith (FAO-56 PM) is the standard method to calculate ET0 recommended by Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). But this method demands too many parameters and these meteorological inputs are not commonly available or unreliable, especially in Xinjiang province. Under this situation, machine learning algorithms have been introduced to estimate ET0 using fewer meteorological parameters and many comparisons of their prediction accuracy have been conducted. But the input combinations of meteorological factors are various and lack theoretical support. Meanwhile, the comparison of their performance at different time-scales has not been comprehensively conducted yet, and the good stability and less computational effort of models are also less to consider. The objective of this research was to evaluate machine learning algorithms' performance in modeling daily ET0 and monthly ET0 using fewer meteorological factors in Xinjiang. At this point, by using data collected from 41 weather stations in Xinjiang, this paper used Sensitivity Coefficient (SV) to evaluate the meteorological factors' influence degree to ET0 and then combined factors with high influence as input to Support Vector Machine (SVM), Gradient Boosted Decision Tree (GBDT), Random Forest (RF), and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) in modeling daily and monthly ET0, and finally investigated and compared the performance of these algorithms from accuracy, stability and computational cost. The results showed RH (SV=-0.516), Tmax (SV=0.283)and U2 (SV=0.266) had high influence to ET0 followed by n (SV=0.124), while Tmin (SV= -0.016) and Tavg (SV= -0.003) exhibited low influence. In modeling daily ET0, models obtained satisfactory accuracy (RMSE<0.5 mm/day, R2>0.95) with input combination of RH, Tmax, U2 and n, while combination of RH、Tmax and U2 showed comparable accuracy for monthly ET0 prediction. The SVM and GBDT models showed the best performance and have been recommended for daily and monthly ET0 estimation in Xinjiang and maybe elsewhere with similar climates around the world. © 2020, Science Press.

Thus, precise estimation of ETc is valuable for various applications of agricultural water engineering, especially in developing countries such as Egypt, which has lack of meteorological data, high cost and time to calculate ETc, and lack of information on future ETc values to consider management scenarios and increase production potential. Also, due to the existence of different climates in Egypt, the estimate of ETc has become a challenge. To this end, the aim of this study was to estimate the ETc to eliminate the limitations mentioned, and analyze the long-term dynamics of ETc based on limited climate data and simple method. Three Egyptian governorates namely Ad Daqahliyah, Ash Sharqiyah, and Kafr ash Shaykh of Nile Delta, were selected as major wheat-producing sites. The required historical required climatic data were collected from open access data library while future data were from two extreme scenarios of the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) i.e., RCP 4.5, and RCP 8.5. The available dataset was divided into three parts: (i) calibration from 1970−2000, (ii) validation from 2000−2017, and (iii) prediction from 2022−2035. The deep neural network (DNN) was employed for incorporating historical data and predicting future ETc. For the evaluation of generated DNN models, the research finding indicates that the correlation coefficients between actual versus predicted monthly ETc were found to be 0.95, 0.96, and 0.97 for calibration period, and 0.94, 0.95 and 0.95 for validation at Ad Daqahliyah, Kafr ash Shaykh, and Ash Sharqiyah regions, respectively. For the simulation of future climatic data, maximum temperature (Tmax) will increased by 5.19 %, 4.22 %, and 20.82 %, minimum temperature (Tmin) will increased by 1.62 %, 36.44 %, and 27.80 %, and solar radiation (SR) will increased by 6.53 %, 18.74 %, and 28.83 % for the study locations, respectively. Moreover, the DNN model exposed that the Kafr ash Shaykh attain the highest values of ETc with an increase of 11.31 %, slightly increased of 1.38 % for Ad Daqahliyah, and decreased by 15.09 % for Ash Sharqiyah in comparison to the historical data. Thus, the proposed model of crop water-use prediction effectively estimated ETc of wheat and make an efficient decision. The developed models produced satisfactory results for water managers to save water and achieve the sustainability of agricultural water. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Climate change; Crop evapotranspiration; DNN model; Future projection,Daqahliya; Egypt; Kafr ash Shaykh; Nile Delta; Sharqiya; Triticum aestivum; Agricultural robots; Calibration; Cost engineering; Crops; Deep neural networks; Developing countries; Evapotranspiration; Forecasting; Meteorology; Scheduling; Sustainable development; Water supply; Correlation coefficient; Crop evapotranspiration; Increase productions; Irrigation system design; Management scenarios; Minimum temperatures; Semi-arid environments; Water resources planning; agricultural management; calibration; evapotranspiration; irrigation system; machine learning; semiarid region; solar radiation; sustainability; water management; wheat; Deep learning,Yes,Yes,weather station,"climate & meteorology, vegetation indices",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0

One of the factors affecting agricultural drought is the vegetation associated with other drought-related factors. These parameters have a complicated relationship with each other, so machine learning algorithms can be used to predict better and model this phenomenon. Factors considered in this study include vegetation as the most critical factor, Land Surface Temperature (LST), Evapo Transpiration (ET), snow cover, rainfall, soil moisture these are derived from the active and passive sensors of satellite sensors as the products of LST, snow cover and vegetation using images of products of the MODIS sensor, rainfall using the images of the TRMM satellite, and soil moisture using the images of the SMOS satellite during a period from June 2010 to the end of 2018 for the central region of Iran. After that, primary processing was performed on these images. The vegetation index (NDVI) is modelled and predicted using an Artificial Neural Network algorithm (ANN), Support Vector Regression (SVR), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF) for monthly periods. By using these methods we have been able to present a model with desirable accuracy. The ANN approach has provided higher accuracy than the other three algorithms.

In this context, models based on artificial neural networks (ANN) of the retro-propagation type can be an alternative method to estimate ETo in highland regions using a number of input variables limited. The objective of this study is to develop ANN models to estimate ETo for the Peruvian highlands using input variables such as maximum air temperature (Tmax), minimum air temperature (Tmin), hours of sunshine (Sh), relative humidity (Rh) and wind speed (Wv), as an alternative method to FAO Penman–Monteith method (FAO-PM56) and Hargreaves–Samani (HS). Daily climatic datasets recorded at 12 meteorological stations between 1963 and 2015 were selected in this study. For evaluation reason, the ETo calculated using the FAO-PM56 was also considered. The main input variable to ANN modeling is Tmax, followed by Sh and Wv or combinations between them. Hargreaves–Samani (HS) showed a poor performance in the estimation of the ETo in the Peruvian highlands compared to the 13 ANN models. Additionally, it was determined that in stations with lower thermal amplitude (< 14.2 °C) the lowest performance levels are presented in the estimation of the ETo with HS equation, which does not occur markedly with the ANN models that they estimate adequately ETo. Therefore, ANN models represent a great option to replace the FAO-PM56 and HS method, when ETo data series are scarce. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Artificial intelligence; ETo; Highlands; Water requirement,Peru; air temperature; artificial intelligence; artificial neural network; data set; numerical model; Penman-Monteith equation; potential evapotranspiration; relative humidity; wind velocity,Yes,Yes,"weather station, remote sensing, empirical models",climate & meteorology,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

While there is still room for improvement, researchers have been developing physical and machine learning models for decades to predict runoff using rainfall data sets. With the advancement of computational hardware resources and algorithms, deep learning methods such as the long short-term memory (LSTM) model and sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) modeling have shown a good deal of promise in dealing with time series problems by considering long-term dependencies and multiple outputs. This study presents an application of a prediction model based on LSTM and the seq2seq structure to estimate hourly rainfall-runoff. Focusing on two Midwestern watersheds, namely, Clear Creek and Upper Wapsipinicon River in Iowa, these models were used to predict hourly runoff for a 24-hr period using rainfall observation, rainfall forecast, runoff observation, and empirical monthly evapotranspiration data from all stations in these two watersheds. The models were evaluated using the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient, the correlation coefficient, statistical bias, and the normalized root-mean-square error. The results show that the LSTM-seq2seq model outperforms linear regression, Lasso regression, Ridge regression, support vector regression, Gaussian processes regression, and LSTM in all stations from these two watersheds. The LSTM-seq2seq model shows sufficient predictive power and could be used to improve forecast accuracy in short-term flood forecast applications. In addition, the seq2seq method was demonstrated to be an effective method for time series predictions in hydrology. ©2020. American Geophysical Union.

However, the retrieval of natural grassland height at the regional scale by remote sensing data and conventional statistical models will result in large errors, especially in the heterogeneous alpine grassland of the Tibetan Plateau (TP). In this article, we aimed to construct a model based on multiple variables (biogeographical, meteorological, and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) product) using a random forest (RF) algorithm to predict the spatial distribution of grassland height in the TP from 2003 to 2017. The results show the following conditions. 1) Seven variables (elevation, slope, aspect, enhanced vegetation index, reflectance in band seven of MODIS (B7), annual accumulated temperature (≥0 °C), and annual precipitation) that were selected by recursive feature elimination from 11 variables have high importance in the RF model. The final model exhibits good performance, with mean R2 and root mean squared error values of 0.51 and 6.15 cm, respectively, which were determined via 10-fold crossvalidation. 2) The mean grassland height (2003-2017) predicted by the RF model ranges from 5 to 10 cm in most areas of the TP, and the mean height is 10 cm. The grassland height in the east and southeast of the TP is significantly higher than that in other areas. 3) This article achieves a relatively accurate estimation of grassland height over a large spatial scale at 500-m spatial resolution, which plays an important role in accurately estimating aboveground biomass and evapotranspiration over grassland. © 2008-2012 IEEE.",Grassland height; random forest (RF); Tibetan Plateau (TP),China; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau; Decision trees; Mean square error; Radiometers; Remote sensing; Accumulated temperatures; Enhanced vegetation index; Grassland height; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer; Random forest algorithm; Recursive feature elimination; Root mean squared errors; Tibetan Plateau; algorithm; ecological modeling; estimation method; grassland; height determination; machine learning; MODIS; remote sensing; spatial distribution; Random forests,Yes,Yes,"weather station, remote sensing","climate & meteorology, vegetation indices",0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0

But our ability to record the change of land water storage is weak despite its importance. In this study, we attempt to establish a data-driven model for simulating terrestrial water storage dynamics by relating climate forcings with terrestrial water storage anomalies (TWSAs) from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellites. In the case study in Pearl River basin, China, the relationships were learned by using two ensemble learning algorithms, the Random Forest (RF) and eXtreme Gradient Boost (XGB), respectively. The TWSA in the basin was reconstructed back to past decades and compared with the TWSA derived from global land surface models. As a result, the RF and XGB algorithms both perform well and could nicely reproduce the spatial pattern and value range of GRACE observations, outperforming the land surface models. Temporal behaviors of the reconstructed TWSA time series well capture those of both GRACE and land surface models time series. A multiscale GRACE-based drought index was proposed, and the index matches the Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index time series at different time scales. The case analysis for years of 1963 and 1998 indicates the ability of the reconstructed TWSA for identifying past drought and flood extremes. The importance of different input variables to the TWSA estimation model was quantified, and the precipitation of the prior 2 months is the most important variable for simulating the TWSA of the current month in the model.

Despite research advancement in the recent decades, results inconsistencies have been reported related to chaotic, stochastic and black box approaches for multi-step ahead prediction of ET0. This study aimed at applying ensemble approaches to improve single and multi-step ahead predictions of ET0. To do so, several Artificial Intelligence (AI) based techniques including Support Vector Regression (SVR), Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) models, were employed for one, two and three-steps ahead predictions of ET0 for numerous climatic stations in Iraq, North Cyprus and Turkey. Monthly meteorological parameters were used as inputs for the models development. Finally, two linear ensemble methods (simple averaging and weighted averaging) and a nonlinear ensemble method (neural ensemble) were applied for the single models performance and reliability improvements. The results showed superior performance of AI based models with regard to the MLR model. In addition, promising improvements were achieved in single and multi-step ahead ET0 modeling by the application of the ensemble models.

Recently, high-throughput plant phenotyping technologies have been adopted that use plant morphological and physiological measurements in a non-destructive manner to accelerate plant breeding processes. Here, a hyperspectral imaging (HSI) technique was implemented to monitor the plant phenotypes of 13 okra (Abelmoschus esculentus L.) genotypes after 2 and 7 days of salt treatment. Physiological and biochemical traits, such as fresh weight, SPAD, elemental contents and photosynthesis-related parameters, which require laborious, time-consuming measurements, were also investigated. Traditional laboratory-based methods indicated the diverse performance levels of different okra genotypes in response to salinity stress. We introduced improved plant and leaf segmentation approaches to RGB images extracted from HSI imaging based on deep learning. The state-of-the-art performance of the deep-learning approach for segmentation resulted in an intersection over union score of 0.94 for plant segmentation and a symmetric best dice score of 85.4 for leaf segmentation. Moreover, deleterious effects of salinity affected the physiological and biochemical processes of okra, which resulted in substantial changes in the spectral information. Four sample predictions were constructed based on the spectral data, with correlation coefficients of 0.835, 0.704, 0.609 and 0.588 for SPAD, sodium concentration, photosynthetic rate and transpiration rate, respectively.

The approach of estimating green area index based on multispectral reflection data from unmanned airborne vehicles with lightweight sensors might have the potential to deliver data with sufficient accuracy and high throughput during the whole season. Materials and Methods: We therefore examined the applicability of a recently launched drone-based multispectral system (Sequoia, Parrot) for the prediction of whole season green area index in winter wheat, with data from field trials in Northern Germany (2017, 2018 and 2019). The explanatory power of different modeling approaches to predict green area index based on multispectral data was tested: linear and non-linear regression models, multivariate techniques, and machine learning algorithms. Further, different predictors were implemented in these models: multispectral data as raw bands and as ratios. Additionally, a new approach for the evaluation of green area index predictions during senescence is introduced. It is shown that a robust calibration during growth phase is applicable during senescence as well. Results and Discussion: A linear model which includes all four wavebands provided by the sensor in three ratios (VIQUO) and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm allow a reliable and sufficiently accurate whole season prediction. The VIQUO-model is recommended as the best model, as it is precise but still relatively simple, thus easier to communicate and to apply than the SVM. The integrated values of predicted green area indices in an independent trial are highly correlated with their final biomass (R2: VIQUO = 0.84, SVM = 0.85) which represents the process of radiation interception, one of the determining factors of growths. This is an indicator for both, a robust model calibration and a high potential of the tested multispectral system for agricultural research and crop management. © Copyright © 2020 Bukowiecki, Rose, Ehlers and Kage.",green area index; multispectral; sequoia camera; unmanned aerial vehicle; vegetation index; whole season; winter wheat,,Yes,Yes,remote sensing,Not Specified,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

That implies a series of limitations, such as small battery life, limited storage capabilities, low accuracy, and imprecise sensors. Data fusion is one of the most widely used methods for improving sensor accuracy and providing a more precise decision. Therefore, we propose Hydra, a multilevel data fusion architecture, to improve sensor accuracy, identify application target events, and make more accurate decisions. Hydra is composed of three layers: low-level (sensor data fusion), medium-level (events and decision making), and high-level (decision fusion based on multiple applications). In partnership with Embrapa (Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation), we instantiated Hydra for the smart agriculture domain, and we also developed two applications aiming smart water management. The first application goal was to determine the need for irrigation based on soil moisture levels, and the second ascertained the adequate irrigation time by estimating the crop's evapotranspiration (rate of water evaporation by the soil and transpiration by plants). We performed a set of experiments to assess Hydra: (i) evaluation of methods to detect and remove outliers; (ii) analyze data resulting from the applications; (iii) the use of machine learning to create a new accurate evapotranspiration model based on the sensors data. The results indicate that a combination of the ESD method (Extreme Studentized Deviate) and WRKF filter (Weighted Outlier-Robust Kalman Filter) was the best method to identify and remove outliers. Moreover, we generated an evapotranspiration model using the SVM (Support Machine Vector) quadratic machine-learning model that produced values close to the evapotranspiration reference model (Penman-Monteith). © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Data fusion; Internet of things; Smart agriculture,Hydra; Data fusion; Decision making; Digital storage; Evapotranspiration; Internet of things; Irrigation; Kalman filters; Machine learning; Soil moisture; Statistics; Transpiration; Water management; Agricultural research; Evaluation of methods; Evapotranspiration modeling; Internet of thing (IOT); Machine learning models; Multiple applications; Robust Kalman filters; Smart agricultures; data acquisition; evapotranspiration; Internet; irrigation system; machine learning; Penman-Monteith equation; sensor; soil moisture; Sensor data fusion,Yes,Yes,empirical models,"climate & meteorology, vegetation indices, soil",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0

The estimates yielded by hybrid machine learning models were compared against three models, Valiantzas-1, 2 and 3 based on root mean square error (RMSE), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) and Willmott index (WI). The results of comparison show that the ANN-GWO-1 model with five input variables (Tmin, Tmax, RH, Us, Rs) provides better estimates at both study stations (RMSE = 0.0592/0.0808, NSE = 0.9972/0.9956, PCC = 0.9986/0.9978, and WI = 0.9993/0.9989).

Lobo F.; Vourlitis G.L.; Rodrigues T.R.,Comparative assessment of modelled and empirical reference evapotranspiration methods for a brazilian savanna,2020,10.1016/j.agwat.2020.106040,"The Brazilian savanna, locally known as Cerrado, native vegetation has been replaced by an agro-pastoral land cover over the last few decades, which has affected its hydrological cycle and the availability of its water resources. Reference evapotranspiration (ETo) estimates are an important tool for water resources managements because they estimate the potential for atmospheric water loss. The Penman-Monteith method (FAO-PM) is recommended by FAO due to its consistent results in different regions and climates, but it requires a high data demand. Several empirical ETo methods with less inputs have been tested around the world, and machine learning approaches have been studied in the recent years. Therefore, in the present paper, 21 empirical methods, classified as mass transfer-based, radiation-based, temperature-based, or combination methods, and 4 equations generated by genetic algorithm (GA) were evaluated against the FAO-PM method. Radiation-based methods were more accurate than the others, especially De Bruin-Keijman and Priestley-Taylor methods, which were the two models with best performance. Mass transfer-based and temperature-based models were deemed unsuitable due to their high errors and low correlation when compared to the other ETo methods. Among the combination methods, the Copais method showed the fifth best result from all the empirical equations tested. The GA equations were generated based on our results, considering the mass transfer-based and temperature-based models, however only one equation, using air temperature and solar radiation as inputs, presented a performance as good as the best methods found in our study. Therefore, alternatives empirical equations and GA approach could meet ETo estimates similar to the FAO-PM method using less inputs. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Comparative analysis cerrado; Eddy covariance; Genetic algorithm; Limited data; Reference evapotranspiration,Boeotia; Central Greece; Copais; Greece; Genetic algorithms; Mass transfer; Cerrado; Comparative assessment; Eddy covariance; Limited data; Machine learning approaches; Penman-Monteith method; Reference evapotranspiration; Water resources management; air temperature; cerrado; data interpretation; eddy covariance; empirical analysis; evapotranspiration; genetic algorithm; hydrological cycle; machine learning; Penman-Monteith equation; Evapotranspiration,Yes,Yes,empirical models,"climate & meteorology, vegetation indices",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0

Nevertheless, reliable estimation of ETo is difficult when lack of complete or long-term meteorological data at the target station. This study evaluated the efficiency of a new tree-based soft computing model, Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM), for estimating daily ET0 using limited local (target-station) and external (cross-station) meteorological data from 49 weather stations in humid subtropical region of China, including 16 in Jiangxi Province and other 33 in the region. The performance of LightGBM was compared with the tree-based M5 Model Tree (M5Tree) and Random Forests (RF) as well as four empirical models (Hargreaves-Samani, Tabari, Makkink and Trabert). Eight input combinations of daily meteorological data including maximum temperature (Tmax), minimum temperature (Tmin), relative humidity (Hr), wind speed at 2 m height (U2), extraterrestrial solar radiation (Ra) and global solar radiation (Rs) calculated from sunshine duration (n) for the period 2001–2015 were used to test the models. The results showed that LightGBM was superior to M5Tree and RF in local applications under all input combinations during testing, with average root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.08–0.58 mm d−1, 0.11–0.62 mm d     and 0.13–0.60 mm d−1, respectively. M5Tree performed slightly better than RF under input combinations 6–8, whereas RF outperformed M5Tree under the other input combinations. However, all three soft computing models produced much better daily ETo estimates than the corresponding empirical models with the same input variables. Rs was the most influential meteorological variable for daily ETo estimation in this region, followed by Tmax and Tmin, Hr and finally U2. In external applications, LightGBM also generally performed better than the RF, M5Tree and empirical models. Soft computing models developed with meteorological data from Station 57894, having the most similar climatic characteristics to the other stations, gave satisfactory ETo estimates for the 15 cross stations in Jiangxi Province, even for the other 33 stations across the humid subtropical region of China. LightGBM was proved to be efficient and exhibit good generalization capability in both local and external applications, which was thus recommended as an alternative model for daily ETo estimation. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Cross station; Light Gradient Boosting Machine; Machine learning; Penman–Monteith equation; Reference evapotranspiration; Tree-based model,Adaptive boosting; Decision trees; Evapotranspiration; Irrigation; Learning systems; Mean square error; Scheduling; Soft computing; Solar radiation; Tropics; Water management; Wind; Agricultural water management; Cross station; Generalization capability; Light gradients; Meteorological variables; Reference evapotranspiration; Root mean square errors; Tree-based model; computer simulation; evapotranspiration; individual-based model; machine learning; meteorology; Penman-Monteith equation; reference sample; tree; Meteorology,Yes,Yes,"weather station, empirical models","climate & meteorology, vegetation indices",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0

An APP (IrriMobile) that uses ANNs based on temperature and relative humidity, or on temperature only, was developed to estimate the reference evapotranspiration (ETo). The APP and Bernardo's methodology for irrigation scheduling, with the ETo estimated by the FAO-56 Penman-Monteith equation, were used to schedule the irrigation for a green corn crop. The performance of empirical equations to estimate ETo was also assessed. Several corn morphological and agronomic characteristics were evaluated. The APP was used in the experiment with temperature, relative humidity, and rainfall data. Its use was also simulated with temperature and rainfall data only. There was no difference for any of the green corn characteristics evaluated. ETo estimation through the APP showed a higher performance than that by the evaluated equations.

We developed a physics constrained machine learning (ML) model (hybrid model) to estimate latent heat flux (LE), which conserves the surface energy budget. By comparing model predictions with observations at 82 eddy covariance tower sites, our hybrid model shows similar performance to the pure ML model in terms of mean metrics (e.g., mean absolute percent errors) but, importantly, the hybrid model conserves the surface energy balance, while the pure ML model does not. A second key result is that the hybrid model extrapolates much better than the pure ML model, emphasizing the benefits of combining physics with ML for increased generalizations. The hybrid model allows inferring the structural dependence of ET and surface resistance (rs), and we find that vegetation height and soil moisture are the main regulators of ET and rs. ©2019.

This complexity can be solved applying the machine learning techniques with different meteorological input variables. This study investigated the performance of k-Nearest Neighbour (kNN), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost) models to predict daily potato ETc using four scenarios of available meteorological data as: air temperature (scenario 1), air temperature and solar radiation (scenario 2), air temperature, solar radiation and wind speed (scenario 3), and air temperature, solar radiation, wind speed and relative humidity (scenarios 4). The analysis was based on the results of experimental trials carried out in Southern Italy in 2009 and 2010 and focussed on the potato crop cultivation under optimal water supply. The results of ETc estimation with different machine learning techniques were compared with ETc obtained from the soil water balance model, based on the FAO Penman Monteith approach, and gravimetric measurements of soil water content in the crop root zone. The best performances were observed with the kNN model with R2 of 0.813, 0.968 and 0.965, slope of regression 0.947, 0.980 and 0.991, modelling efficiency (EF) of 0.848, 0.970 and 0.972, root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.790, 0.351 and 0.355 mm day−1, mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.563, 0.263 and 0.274 mm day−1 and mean squared error (MSE) of 0.623, 0.123 and 0.126 mm day−1 for scenarios 1, 2 and 3, respectively. When all meteorological variables were available (scenario 4), the ANN model produced slightly better statistical indicators. Therefore, the kNN model could be recommended for the estimation of ETc when limited meteorological data are available. Otherwise, the ANN model should be applied. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Adaptive boosting; Artificial neural networks; k-Nearest neighbour; Mediterranean region; Penman-Monteith equation,Solanum tuberosum; Adaptive boosting; Atmospheric temperature; Complex networks; Crops; Errors; Evapotranspiration; Mean square error; Meteorology; Nearest neighbor search; Neural networks; Soil moisture; Solar radiation; Water supply; Wind; Gravimetric measurements; K nearest neighbours (k-NN); K-nearest neighbours; Machine learning techniques; Mediterranean region; Meteorological variables; Penman-Monteith equations; Soil water balance model; air temperature; artificial neural network; bootstrapping; estimation method; evapotranspiration; machine learning; Mediterranean environment; Penman-Monteith equation; potato; relative humidity; rhizosphere; solar radiation; wind velocity; Machine learning,Yes,Yes,"weather station, load cells, empirical models","climate & meteorology, vegetation indices",0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0

Seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA), support vector machine (SVM), and group method of data handling (GMDH) models were developed and assessed to find an appropriate model for short and long-term forecasting of monthly reference evapotranspiration in the Guilan Plain, northern Iran. Monthly meteorological data gathered from four weather stations (Anzali, Astara, Manjil, and Rasht) were used to calculate monthly reference evapotranspiration in the period of 1993-2014 using the FAO-56 Penman-Monteith (FAO-PM) equation. The evapotranspiration data from 1993 to 2012 were used to fit SARIMA models and calibrate SVM and GMDH models, and the monthly evapotranspiration rates for the years 2013 and 2014 were forecasted using the calibrated models. The developed models were assessed using RMS error (RMSE), the Pearson correlation coefficient (R), the Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient (NS), and percent bias. Taylor diagrams also were used to compare the accuracy of forecasts produced by the models. For the whole forecasting period (2013-2014), the RMSE of the calibrated SARIMA, SVM, and GMDH models were, respectively, 8.796, 9.830, and 9.547 mm/month for Anzali weather station; 8.136, 9.057, and 7.808 mm/month for Astara weather station; 9.454, 8.947, and 8.876 mm/month for Manjil weather station; and 9.301, 10.509, and 10.138 mm/month for Rasht weather station. In other words, in two weather stations under study (Anzali and Rasht), the best results were obtained from SARIMA; however, for Astara and Manjil weather stations, GMDH generated the best forecasts. Furthermore, at different forecasting horizons (1-24 months), the SARIMA models generally outperformed the SVM and GMDH models. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Evapotranspiration; Machine learning; Seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA); Support vector machine,Gilan; Iran; Autoregressive moving average model; Correlation methods; Data handling; Evapotranspiration; Learning systems; Meteorology; Support vector machines; Water management; Weather information services; Comparative studies; Group method of data handling; Long-term forecasting; Meteorological data; Pearson correlation coefficients; Reference evapotranspiration; Seasonal autoregressive integrated moving averages; Water management projects; artificial neural network; comparative study; evapotranspiration; forecasting method; hydrological modeling; long-term change; support vector machine; time series analysis; Weather forecasting,Yes,Yes,"weather station, empirical models","climate & meteorology, vegetation indices, plant physiology",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1

Consequently, the lack of geophysical characteristics such as soil properties leads to difficulties in developing physical and analytical models when traditional statistical methods cannot simulate rainfall-runoff accurately. Machine learning techniques with data-driven methods, which can capture the nonlinear relationship between prediction and predictors, have been rapidly developed in the last decades and have many applications in the field of water resources. This study attempts to develop a novel 1D convolutional neural network (CNN), a deep learning technique, with a ReLU activation function for rainfall-runoff modelling. The modelling paradigm includes applying two convolutional filters in parallel to separate time series, which allows for the fast processing of data and the exploitation of the correlation structure between the multivariate time series. The developed modelling framework is evaluated with measured data at Chau Doc and Can Tho hydro-meteorological stations in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta. The proposed model results are compared with simulations of long short-term memory (LSTM) and traditional models. Both CNN and LSTM have better performance than the traditional models, and the statistical performance of the CNN model is slightly better than the LSTM results. We demonstrate that the convolutional network is suitable for regression-type problems and can effectively learn dependencies in and between the series without the need for a long historical time series, is a time-efficient and easy to implement alternative to recurrent-type networks and tends to outperform linear and recurrent models. © IWA Publishing 2020.",1D CNN; Deep learning; LSTM; Mekong Delta; Rainfall-runoff,,Yes,Yes,weather station,climate & meteorology,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

While agro-meteorology networks cover most agricultural production areas in the U.S., widely spaced stations represent regionally specific, rather than site-specific, conditions. A variety of low to moderate cost commercial weather stations are available but do not provide directly useful information, such as actual evapotranspiration (ETa), or the ability to incorporate additional sensors. We demonstrate that machine learning methods can provide real-time, site-specific information about ETa and crop water demand using on-farm sensors and public weather information. Two years of field experiments were conducted at four irrigated field sites with crops including snap beans, alfalfa, and pasture. On-farm data were compared to publicly available data originating at nearby agro-meteorology network stations. The machine learning procedure can robustly estimate ETa using data from a few basic sensors, but the resulting estimate is sensitive to the range of conditions that are used as training data. The results demonstrate that machine learning can be used with affordable sensors and publicly available data to improve local estimates of crop water demand when high-quality measurements can be co-located for short periods of time. Supplementary sensors can also be integrated into a tailored monitoring plan to estimate crop stress and other operational considerations. © 2020 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.",Agro-meteorology; Irrigation requirement; Machine learning; Site-specific irrigation,United States; Medicago sativa; Agricultural robots; Crops; Decision support systems; Meteorology; Actual evapotranspiration; Agricultural productions; Decision supports; High-quality measurements; Irrigation scheduling; Machine learning methods; Site-specific information; Weather information; agricultural production; agrometeorology; decision support system; detection method; evapotranspiration; machine learning; sensor; Machine learning,Yes,Yes,weather station,climate & meteorology,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

The accumulation of contaminants in plant roots and edible tissues is measured by root concentration factor (RCF) and fruit concentration factor (FCF). In this paper, 1) a neural network (NN) was applied to model RCF based on physicochemical properties of organic compounds, 2) correlation and significance of physicochemical properties were assessed using statistical analysis, 3) fuzzy logic was used to examine the simultaneous impacts of significant compound properties on RCF and FCF, 4) a clustering algorithm (k-means) was used to identify unique groups and discover hidden relationships within contaminants in various parts of the plants. The physicochemical cutoffs achieved by fuzzy logic for the RCF and the FCF were compared versus the cutoffs for compounds that crossed the plant root membranes and found their way into transpiration stream (measured by transpiration stream concentration factor, TSCF). The NN predicted the RCF with improved accuracy compared to mechanistic models. The analysis indicated that log Kow, molecular weight, and rotatable bonds are the most important properties for predicting the RCF. These significant compound properties are positively correlated with RCF while they are negatively correlated with TSCF. Comparing the relationships between compound properties in various plant tissues showed that compounds detected in the edible parts have physicochemical cutoffs that are more like the compounds crossing the plant root membranes (into xylem tissues) than the compounds accumulating in the plant roots, with clear relationships to food security.

In order to reflect the daily crop coefficient changes of the crops, this study comprehensively considered the common influence of meteorological and biological factors on crop growth, a meteorological-physiological double function multiplication model was established based on geothermal temperature and leaf area index by using the evapotranspiration data and meteorological data of summer maize of lysimeter of the Wudaogou Hydrological Experimental Station. Combining with the gradient descent method, a meteorological-physiological double function multiplication model was constructed to estimate crop coefficients and optimize the accuracy of the model. The results showed that the model calculated the crop coefficient of summer maize. The model could also be used for the estimation of the evapotranspiration of summer maize with higher precision. In different samples, including training samples and test samples, and the entire growth period of summer maize, the precision calculated by the model was high. In the entire growth period of summer maize, between the measured value and the calculated value, the average absolute error was only 0.12. In addition, the root meant square error was 0.15. And the correlation was 0.91 between the measured value and the calculated value on the crop coefficient of summer maize. Regarding the estimation of evapotranspiration, between the measured value and the calculated value, the average absolute error was only 1.0 mm/d, and the root meant square error was 4.5 mm/d. In addition, the correlation was 0.75 between the measured value and the calculated value on the evapotranspiration of summer maize. And by using the crop coefficient of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) which was recommended, the evapotranspiration of summer maize was calculated. And the model constructed in this study was compared with the calculated results, it was found that the evapotranspiration accuracy calculated by meteorological-physiological double function multiplication model was increased by more than 3 times when the error between measured value. The calculated value was within 2 mm/d and 3 mm/d. And the error was almost all within 4 mm/d. In this study, the meteorological-physiological double function multiplication model based on ground temperature and leaf area index could be more accurately used for crop coefficient and actual evapotranspiration calculation of summer maize. And the research incorporated a machine learning algorithm (a multi-disciplinary interdisciplinary) to further improve the accuracy of crop coefficient calculation. The construction of an accurate crop coefficient model had great significance for the accurate prediction of evapotranspiration and further for the development of accurate irrigation plans. The model simplified the calculation of summer corn crop coefficients, clarified the comprehensive influence degree of ground temperature and leaf area index on crop coefficients, improved the calculation accuracy, and could be used for the dynamic calculation of corn crop coefficients. The evapotranspiration data measured by a large-scale weighing lysimeter at the Wudaogou Hydrological Experimental Station was used to calculate the actual crop coefficient in combination with a series of meteorological data. The crop coefficient and leaf area index were fitted using the Michaelis-Menten equation to obtain the influence of biological factors. The multi-factor regression was used to select the meteorological factor-ground temperature (0 cm), which had the closest effect on the crop coefficient, and performed exponential fitting. Finally, the gradient descent method was used to optimize the model parameters, and the measured results were used to evaluate the calculation results. It had great significance to grasp the dynamic change characteristics of crop coefficients during the summer maize growth period and accurately estimate the actual evapotranspiration of crops. © 2020, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

With an increasing amount of “big data” from earth observation and rapid advances in ML, increasing opportunities for novel methods have emerged to aid in earth environmental monitoring. Over the last decade, a typical and state-of-the-art ML framework named deep learning (DL), which is developed from the traditional neural network (NN), has outperformed traditional models with considerable improvement in performance. Substantial progress in developing a DL methodology for a variety of earth science applications has been observed. Therefore, this review will concentrate on the use of the traditional NN and DL methods to advance the environmental remote sensing process. First, the potential of DL in environmental remote sensing, including land cover mapping, environmental parameter retrieval, data fusion and downscaling, and information reconstruction and prediction, will be analyzed. A typical network structure will then be introduced. Afterward, the applications of DL environmental monitoring in the atmosphere, vegetation, hydrology, air and land surface temperature, evapotranspiration, solar radiation, and ocean color are specifically reviewed.

Support vector regression (SVR), Extreme learning machine (ELM), and Multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS) — three machine learning (ML) techniques — served to establish relationships between historical ET0 and the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment – East Asia (CORDEX-EA), drawn from the output data sets of each of three regional climate models (RCM): Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF), Regional Climate Model version 4.0 (RegCM4) and the Mesoscale Model version 5 (MM5). The ML-RCM combinations were calibrated and validated with separate batches (66:34, respectively) of historical ET0 data, and their respective performance and level of uncertainty were assessed statistically. In the historical period (1960–2017) ET0 declined by −0.15, −0.75, and − 0.42 mm y− 1 in north Xinjiang, south Xinjiang, and Qinghai region, respectively, and increased in the Hexi Corridor by 0.5 mm y− 1. For all four regions, the MARS-WRF and MARS-MM5 combinations performed well and showed greater predictive accuracy than either ELM-WRF or ELM-MM5 combinations. Performances in predicting future (2035–2050) ET0 from CORDEX-EA outputs based on regional climate predictions RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios, depended to a greater extent on the RCM outputs that were selected, rather than the modeling methods. Future ET0 predicted from RCMs generally exhibit increasing trends, and more significantly under the RCP 8.5 scenario. The representation and characterization ability of RCMs to future climate change is crucial for future ET0 projection. Uncertainty analysis, achieved by employing multiple RCMs to predict future ET0, is highly recommended. Knowledge of trends in future ET0 can help guide the management of agricultural irrigation in oases and support decision-makers engaged in water resources management in the future. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",CORDEX-EA; Machine learning algorithm; Northwest China; Reference evapotranspiration,China; Agricultural robots; Climate change; Decision making; Evapotranspiration; Irrigation; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Machine learning; Scheduling; Support vector regression; Uncertainty analysis; Weather forecasting; CORDEX-EA; Multivariate adaptive regression splines; NorthWest China; Reference evapotranspiration; Spatio-temporal variation; Support vector regression (SVR); Water resources management; Weather research and forecasting; algorithm; downscaling; evapotranspiration; hydrological cycle; irrigation; machine learning; multivariate analysis; quantitative analysis; regional climate; spatial variation; support vector machine; temporal variation; uncertainty analysis; water resource; Climate models,Yes,Yes,weather station,"climate & meteorology, vegetation indices",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0

Leaf area has also been established as an important factor affecting water consumption. We analyzed a multivariable time series composed of both meteorological and vegetative variables with a daily temporal resolution for the growing seasons of 2013–2016 for Vitis vinfera ‘Cabernet Sauvignon’ vineyards in the mountainous region in Israel. Time-series analysis of this data was used to characterize seasonal patterns affecting water consumption (ETc) of vines and to quantify interrelations between meteorological and vegetative factors affecting vine water consumption. Moreover, we applied a machine learning regression model to determine the relative influence of meteorological and vegetative factors on ETc during four growing seasons. Finally, we developed an ensemble model for temporally forecasting vine ETc for an additional season using a training dataset of multiple variables. Our findings show that decomposing the time-series dataset uncovered a wider variety of underlying temporal patterns, and enabled quantification of seasonal and daily relationships. Leaf area had a substantial impact on ETc and was found to have a relative influence ranging between 62 and 86% for the different growing seasons. Mean temperature was ranked second followed by minor effects of relative humidity, solar radiation and wind speed that were interchangeably ordered. The ensemble model produced reliable results, with cross validation coefficients ~ 0.9. Incorporating leaf area measurements into the regression model improved both the performance of the model and the training data correlation. Using time-series statistics to explore meteorological and vegetative temporal characteristics, patterns, interrelations and relative effect on evapotranspiration may facilitate the understanding of water consumption processes and assist in generating more effective and skillful irrigation models. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Agricultural meteorology; Drainage lysimeters; Evapotranspiration; Machine learning; Time series analysis; Vitis vinifera,Vitis; Vitis vinifera; evapotranspiration; irrigation system; leaf area; machine learning; relative humidity; seasonal variation; solar radiation; vine; water use; wind velocity,Yes,Yes,weather station,"climate & meteorology, vegetation indices",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0

However, the precise determination of ETo is fairly difficult, and complex machine learning approaches are often used for this. This study, carried out in Veeranam tank, India, determines the multivariate analysis of correlated variables involved in the estimation and modelling of ETo from 1995 to 2016. A reduced-feature data model was constructed with the most significant variables of the model extracted by principal component analysis. This work also explores the effectiveness of a deep learning neural network (DLNN) with the reduced-feature model in predicting ETo in comparison with the conventional Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO-56) Penman-Monteith equation and the radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) as a baseline machine learning method. The input variable dimensionality was reduced from six to three most significant variables in ETo modelling.

The hydrological response to the downscaled meteorological data was evaluated using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model. The results indicated that the temperature downscaled in southeastern China was better than that in northwestern China, while precipitation was the opposite. Although RNN and ANN model had different feasibility in different regions of China, the performance of RNN model for maximum and minimum temperature downscaling was about 6% and 10% better than that of ANN model overall, respectively. And RNN model was better for extreme temperature conditions simulation. Regarding precipitation, the performance of RNN and ANN model was similar when simulating precipitation amount. However, the use of RNN model improved the prediction accuracy of dry and wet days. In order to improve the accuracy of extreme precipitation downscaling, a new model, RNN-RandExtreme, was proposed. Compared with the ANN and single RNN model, RNN-RandExtreme model improved the prediction accuracy of extreme precipitation by 28.32% and 16.56%, respectively. The hydrological simulation results of SWAT model showed that the RNN and RNN-RandExtreme model significantly improved the accuracy of hydrological simulations of flow and evapotranspiration compared to the ANN model. However, as the time scale became rougher (from daily to annual scale), the improvement effect of RNN and RNN-RandExtreme model would weaken. The results of this study may help improving the accuracy of statistical downscaling, and support choosing downscaling models in different areas. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Climate change; Hydrological response; Recurrent neural network; Statistical downscaling; SWAT model,China; Big data; Climate change; Precipitation (meteorology); Recurrent neural networks; Hydrologic simulations; Hydrological response; Hydrological simulations; Maximum and minimum temperatures; Recurrent neural network (RNN); Soil and water assessment tool; Statistical downscaling; SWAT model; artificial neural network; climate change; data set; downscaling; evapotranspiration; hydrological modeling; hydrological response; machine learning; simulation; soil and water assessment tool; statistical analysis; Climate models,Yes,Yes,weather station,"climate & meteorology, vegetation indices",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0

Traditional evapotranspiration (ET) partitioning dual source modeling requires an extensive array of ground-level parameters and needs model correction and calibration to attain model certainty. In response, a quick and low-cost method is described to predict T using artificial intelligence (AI) modeling based on meteorological factors, status of crop growth factors and soil parameters. This study compares Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Regression (SVR) in building AI models using three years (2014–2017) of continuous high-resolution monitoring data in a cabbage farmland. Input data included air temperature (Ta), solar radiation (Ra), relative humidity (RH), vapor pressure deficit (VPD), wind speed (Ws), soil moisture (SM), vegetation height (H), and leaf area index (LAI). The results show that soil surface resistance calculations by Monte Carlo iterative method and vegetation stomatal resistance calculations and carbon dioxide concentration and emission, improve performance of the original Shuttleworth–Wallace(S-W) model. In addition, the AI model indicates Ta and Ra are essential inputs for both model types. When there are sufficient observation data, or only lacking soil and vegetation data, the RF model is recommended for use. When there are only limited data or lack of critical Ta and Ra data, the SVR model is the preferred model. Scientific guidance is provided for agriculture precision irrigation, indicating which AI model can best estimate T and water demand for irrigation planning and water management. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Random forest; Shuttleworth–wallace model; Support vector regression; Vegetation transpiration,Brassica oleracea var. capitata; Carbon dioxide; Decision trees; Evapotranspiration; Farms; Irrigation; Iterative methods; Monte Carlo methods; Regression analysis; Soil moisture; Surface resistance; Tantalum; Transpiration; Vegetation; Water management; Wind; Carbon dioxide concentrations; Daily evapotranspirations; High-resolution monitoring; Random forests; Soil surface resistance; Support vector regression (SVR); Vapor pressure deficit; Water resources management; agricultural land; agricultural practice; air temperature; algorithm; artificial intelligence; carbon dioxide; evapotranspiration; growth; leaf area index; leafy vegetable; model; precision agriculture; relative humidity; soil moisture; soil surface; solar radiation; support vector machine; water demand; wind velocity; Soil pollution,Yes,Yes,weather station,"climate & meteorology, vegetation indices, soil, plant physiology",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1

In the present study, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm was utilized to optimally determine the parameters of the extreme learning machine (ELM) model, and a novel hybrid PSO-ELM model was thus proposed for estimating daily ETo in the arid region of Northwest China with limited input data. The PSO-ELM model was compared with the original ELM, artificial neural networks (ANN) and random forests (RF) models as along with six empirical models (including radiation-, temperature- and mass transfer-based empirical models). Three input combinations were utilized to develop the data-driven models, which corresponded to the radiation-, temperature- and mass transfer-based models, respectively. The results indicated that machine learning models provided more accurate ETo estimates, compared with the corresponding empirical models with the same inputs. The hybrid PSO-ELM model exhibited better performance than the other models for daily ETo estimation as indicated by the statistical results. Although radiation-based machine learning models outperformed temperature- and mass transfer-based machine learning models, the temperature-based PSO-ELM model obtained reasonable results when only air temperature data were available, which was considered as a promising model for forecasting future ETo with temperature data. Overall, the PSO-ELM model was superior to the other machine learning and empirical models, which was thus recommended to predict daily ETo with limited inputs in the arid region of Northwest China. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Extreme learning machine; Modeling; Particle swarm optimization; Random forests; Reference evapotranspiration,China; Agricultural robots; Arid regions; Decision trees; Evapotranspiration; Forecasting; Irrigation; Knowledge acquisition; Mass transfer; Neural networks; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Scheduling; Swarm intelligence; Transfer learning; Crop water requirements; Extreme learning machine; Hybrid Particle Swarm Optimization; Irrigation scheduling; Machine learning models; Particle swarm optimization algorithm; Reference evapotranspiration; Water resources management; air temperature; algorithm; arid region; evapotranspiration; machine learning; optimization; temperature effect; Learning systems,Yes,Yes,Not Specified,"climate & meteorology, vegetation indices",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0

Understanding and correctly modeling soil moisture–precipitation (SM–P) coupling is crucial for improving weather forecasting and subseasonal to seasonal climate predictions, especially when predicting the persistence and magnitude of drought. However, the sign and spatial structure of SM–P feedback are still being debated in the climate research community, mainly due to the difficulty in establishing causal relationships and the high degree of nonlinearity in land–atmosphere processes. To this end, we developed a causal inference model based on the Granger causality analysis and a nonlinear machine learning model. This model includes three steps: nonlinear anomaly decomposition, nonlinear Granger causality analysis, and evaluation of the quality of SM–P feedback, which eliminates the nonlinear response of interannual and seasonal variability and the memory effects of climatic factors and isolates the causal relationship of local SM–P feedback. We applied this model by using National Climate Assessment–Land Data Assimilation System (NCA-LDAS) datasets over the United States. The results highlight the importance of nonlinear atmosphere responses in land–atmosphere interactions. In addition, the strong feedback over the southwestern United States and the Great Plains both highlight the impacts of topographic factors rather than only the sensitivity of evapotranspiration to soil moisture. Furthermore, the SM–P index defined by our framework is used to benchmark Earth system models (ESMs), which provides a new metric for efficiently identifying potential model biases in modeling local land–atmosphere interactions and may help the development of ESMs in improving simulations of water cycle variability and extremes. © 2020, American Meteorological Society.

However, the impacts of climate change on the dynamics of carbon and water fluxes in global semi-arid ecosystems are still not well understood. We used a data-driven (or machine learning) approach, along with observations from a number of FLUXNET sites and spatially continuous satellite and meteorological data, to generate gridded carbon and water flux estimates for semi-arid regions globally, and then examined the magnitude, spatial patterns, and trends of carbon and water fluxes and their responses to climate change during the period 1982-2015. The average annual gross primary productivity (GPP), net ecosystem productivity (NEP), evapotranspiration (ET), and water use efficiency (WUE) were 628.6 g C m-2 yr-1, 9.6 g C m-2 yr-1, 463.1 mm yr-1, and 1.60 g C Kg-1 H2O, respectively. The climate conditions during the period 1982-2015 enhanced gross and net carbon uptake in global semi-arid regions. The spatially-averaged annual GPP, NEP, ET, and WUE in semi-arid regions showed significant increases both globally and regionally (Asia, Africa, and Australia). As with GPP and ET, WUE significantly increased in North America, Asia, Africa, and Australia. Australia was the most sensitive semi-arid region in terms of changes in carbon and water fluxes and their responses to climate. Semi-arid forests, shrublands, and savannas were net carbon sinks; croplands were minor carbon sources; grasslands were nearly carbon neutral. Overall, precipitation was the most important climate factor influencing the carbon and water fluxes; WUE in 40.9% of the semi-arid region was significantly influenced by precipitation. The global climate change is expected to influence global semi-arid ecosystems in many ways and our findings have implications for semi-arid ecosystem management and policy making. © 2020 The Author(s).

Some crops, such as cranberries, are susceptible to both water and anoxic stresses. Excessive variations in soil matric potential in the root zone may reduce plant transpiration, due to either saturated or dry soil conditions, thereby reducing productivity. A timely supply of the right amount of water is, therefore, fundamental for efficient irrigation management. In this paper, we compare the capabilities of a machine learning-based model and a physics-based model to predict soil matric potential in the root zone. The machine learning model is a random forest algorithm, while the physics-based model is a two-dimensional solver of Richards equation (HYDRUS 2D). After training and calibration on a dataset collected in a cranberry field located in Québec (Canada), the performance of the two models is evaluated for 30 different time frames of 72-h soil matric potential forecasts. The results highlight that both models can accurately forecast the soil matric potential in the root zone. The machine learning-based model can achieve better performance when compared to the physics-based model, but forecasting accuracy decreases rapidly toward the end of the 72-h lead time, while the error for the Richards equation-based model does not increase with time and remain small compared to the typical measurement error.

This study focuses on estimating, predicting and modeling crop coefficients kc of maize which is an important parameter for calculating ETc by using artificial neural networks models (ANN) and fewer parameters. Altogether, four major maize producing Egyptian governorates (Ad Dakahliyah, Al Gharbiyah, Ash Sharqiyah, and Al Ismailiyah) were selected and the monthly data of minimum and maximum temperature, solar radiation, wind speed, and vapor pressure deficit were extracted from open access data (GIS-raster) over the period from 2006 to 2016. The analyzed datasets were divided into two segments from 2006 to 2014 for training and from 2015 to 2016 for testing. The results indicated that data combination of minimum temperature, maximum temperature, and solar radiation was the best artificial intelligence model for predicting kc in four sites with differing hidden layers. The hidden neuron layers were (7, 5), (8, 6), (9, 6), and (9, 7) for Ad Daqahliyah, Al Gharbiyah, Ash Sharqiyah, and Al Ismailiyah, respectively. There was a statistically significant consistency between the measured and modeled values in four locations, and the analysis showed the distributional differences between the actual FAO CROPWAT Model and modeled values were small. The accuracy of the best model and correlation coefficients for prediction kc are close to 1. Thus, the developed model was proven to produce high accuracy and it is recommended to predict the accurate value of kc with limited climatic factors.

This study explored the ability of several machine learning models based on penalized linear regression and decision tree (DT)-based ensemble methods to predict drought conditions represented by the Standardized Precipitation–Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) in Northeast China. We compared the forecasting performance of the penalized linear regression models based on ridge regression (RR) and lasso regression (LR) with the ordinary least squares (OLS) regression model. In addition, the AdaBoost and Random Forests (RF) models were also used to explore the suitability of ensemble methods for improving the forecasting performance.

Estimating high-resolution LST precisely is essential to understand heat change processes in urban environments. Existing LST products with coarse spatial resolution retrieved from satellite-based thermal infrared imagery have limited use in the detailed study of surface energy balance, evapotranspiration, and climatic change at the urban spatial scale. Downscaling LST is a practicable approach to obtain high accuracy and high-resolution LST. In this study, a machine learning-based geostatistical downscaling method (RFATPK) is proposed for downscaling LST which integrates the advantages of random forests and area-to-point Kriging methods. The RFATPK was performed to downscale the 90 m Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) LST 10 m over two representative areas in Guangzhou, China. The 10 m multi-type independent variables derived from the Sentinel-2A imagery on 1 November 2017, were incorporated into the RFATPK, which considered the nonlinear relationship between LST and independent variables and the scale effect of the regression residual LST. The downscaled results were further compared with the results obtained from the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) based thermal sharpening method (TsHARP). The experimental results showed that the RFATPK produced 10mLST with higher accuracy than the TsHARP; the TsHARP showed poor performance when downscaling LST in the built-up and water regions because NDVI is a poor indicator for impervious surfaces and water bodies; the RFATPK captured LST difference over different land coverage patterns and produced the spatial details of downscaled LST on heterogeneous regions. More accurate LST data has wide applications in meteorological, hydrological, and ecological research and urban heat island monitoring. © 2020, by the authors.",ASTER; Downscaling; Land surface temperature; RFATPK; Sentinel-2A,Atmospheric temperature; Decision trees; Interpolation; Machine learning; Satellite imagery; Surface measurement; Surface properties; Advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer; Area to point kriging; Heterogeneous region; Independent variables; Non-linear relationships; Normalized difference vegetation index; Regression residuals; Thermal infrared imagery; Land surface temperature,Yes,Yes,"weather station, remote sensing","climate & meteorology, vegetation indices",0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0

A total of 49 ESUs (Elementary Sampling Unit) of 30 m × 30 m size were established based on variability in composition and age of plantation stands. In-situ LAI was recorded using plant canopy imager during the leaf growing, peak and senescence seasons.

The leave-one-out cross-validation method was used to compare the precision of each interpolation algorithm. The results showed that RF obtained better results for the estimation of the reference evapotranspiration than conventional approaches, coming to reduce to roughly half the error obtained. Despite to resolve blocky artifacts present in RF spatial distribution, RFsp did not present better results than RF, obtaining a very similar performance to IDW and OK. Concerning computational performance, IDW obtained the shortest time to create the interpolation model. The IDW also obtained the smallest prediction times. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Agrometeorology; Evapotranspiration; Machine learning; Spatial interpolation,Decision trees; Evapotranspiration; Inverse problems; Learning systems; Machine learning; Statistical methods; Water management; Agrometeorology; Computational performance; Interpolation algorithms; Inverse distance weighting; Leave-one-out cross validations; Reference evapotranspiration; Spatial interpolation; Spatial interpolation method; evapotranspiration; human activity; interpolation; machine learning; numerical model; performance assessment; precision; random walk method; water management; Interpolation,Yes,Yes,weather station,"climate & meteorology, vegetation indices",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0

The objectives of the present study were to assess the performance of machine learning techniques in net primary productivity modeling and to assess regional trends for the Brazilian territory. Net primary production was modeled using evapotranspiration estimates, the normalized difference vegetation index, hypsometry and meteorological data. The models adopted for estimating net primary productivity were stepwise regression, Bayesian regularized neural network and Cubist regression. A linear trend model was applied pixel by pixel in order to verify a significant change in net primary productivity across the Brazilian territory. The Cubist model performed best among the evaluated models, with root-mean-squared error of 135.6 g C m−2 year−1 and R2 equal to 0.78. While assessing the net primary productivity time series, an increased trend was observed for the Brazilian Savannah biome, which may be attributed to the replacement of some Savannah formations and degraded grasslands to agriculture. The developed model has shown a great potential for filling the gap of spatial net primary productivity data in large scales. © 2019, Indian Society of Remote Sensing.",Environmental monitoring; Linear trend models; Machine learning; Remote sensing,Brazil; Georgia; Savannah; United States; biome; ecosystem health; environmental monitoring; evapotranspiration; land degradation; machine learning; model; remote sensing; territory,Yes,Yes,"weather station, remote sensing","climate & meteorology, vegetation indices",0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0

This study evaluated the potential of a new machine learning algorithm using gradient boosting on decision trees with categorical features support (i.e., CatBoost)for accurately estimating daily ET0 with limited meteorological data in humid regions of China. Two other commonly used machine learning algorithms, Random Forests (RF)and Support Vector Machine (SVM), were also assessed for comparison. Eight input combinations of daily meteorological data [including both complete and incomplete combinations of solar radiation (Rs), maximum and minimum temperatures (Tmax and Tmin), relative humidity (Hr)and wind speed (U)]from five weather stations during 2001–2015 in South China were applied for model training and testing. The results showed that all the three algorithms could achieve satisfactory accuracy for ET0 estimation in subtropical China using Rs, Tmax and Tmin, or U, Hr, Tmax and Tmin as inputs, under the circumstances of lacking complete meteorological parameters. The increases in testing RMSE and MAPE over training RMSE and MAPE showed positive correlations with the number of input parameters to the machine learning models. For the local models, among the three algorithms, SVM offered the best prediction accuracy and stability with incomplete combinations of meteorological parameters as inputs, while CatBoost performed best with the complete combination of parameters. Patterns of the generalized models were almost the same as the local models, but the former ones showed less than 10% decreases in RMSE or MAPE in comparison with the latter ones. In addition, the computing time and memory usage for data processing of CatBoost were much less than those of RF and SVM. Overall, as a tree-based algorithm, CatBoost made significant improvements in accuracy, stability and computational cost when compared to RF. Therefore, the CatBoost algorithm has a very high potential for ET0 estimation in humid regions of China, and even possibly in other parts of the world with similar humid climates. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",CatBoost; Computational complexity; Gradient boosting decision tree; Model comparison; Random forests; Support vector machine,China; Adaptive boosting; Computational complexity; Data handling; Decision trees; Evapotranspiration; Irrigation; Machine learning; Meteorology; Scheduling; Support vector machines; Water management; Weather forecasting; Wind; CatBoost; Gradient boosting; Maximum and minimum temperatures; Meteorological parameters; Model comparison; Random forests; Reference evapotranspiration; Waterresource management; algorithm; complexity; evapotranspiration; model; numerical method; prediction; regression analysis; relative humidity; software; support vector machine; water resource; wind velocity; Parameter estimation,Yes,Yes,weather station,"climate & meteorology, vegetation indices",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0

Unfortunately, there are long gaps (i.e., gaps longer than 30 days), particularly in 2007 and 2014, which hinder attempts to analyze these decade-long time-series data. The open source and standardized gap-filling methods are impractical for such long gaps. The data-driven approach using machine learning and remote-sensing or reanalysis data (i.e., interpolating/extrapolating EC measurements via available networks temporally/spatially) for estimating terrestrial CO2/H2O fluxes at the regional/global scale is applicable after appropriate modifications. In this study, we evaluated the applicability of the data-driven approach for filling long gaps in flux data (i.e., gross primary production, ecosystem respiration, net ecosystem exchange, and evapotranspiration). We found that using a longer training dataset in the machine learning generally produced better model performance, although there was a greater possibility of missing interannual variations caused by ecosystem state changes (e.g., changes in crop variety). Based on the results, we proposed gap-filling strategies for long-period flux data gaps and used them to quantify the annual sums with uncertainties in 2007 and 2014. The results from this study have broad implications for long-period gap-filling at other sites, and for the estimation of regional/global CO2/H2O fluxes using a data-driven approach. © 2019 by the authors.",Data-driven approach; Eddy covariance; Gap-filling; Long gap; Long-term database; Uncertainty,Haenam; South Cholla; South Korea; Carbon dioxide; Filling; Machine learning; Remote sensing; Data-driven approach; Eddy covariance; Gap filling; Long gap; Long-term database; Uncertainty; annual variation; data set; database; eddy covariance; machine learning; numerical model; uncertainty analysis; Ecosystems,Yes,Yes,eddy covariance,climate & meteorology,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

We developed state-factor models with machine learning to understand better and to predict the abundance of 10 dominant phyla and bacterial diversities in Australian soils, the latter expressed by the Chao and Shannon indices. In the models, we used proxies for the edaphic, climatic, biotic and topographic factors, which included soil properties, environmental variables, and the absorbance at visible–near infrared (vis–NIR) wavelengths. From a cross-validation with all observations (n = 681), we found that our models explained 43–73% of the variance in bacterial phyla abundance and diversity. The vis–NIR spectra, which represent the organic and mineral composition of soil, were prominent drivers of abundance and diversity in the models, as were changes in the soil-water balance, potential evapotranspiration, and soil nutrients. From independent validations, we found that spectro-transfer functions could predict well the phyla Acidobacteria and Actinobacteria (R2 > 0.7) as well as other dominant phyla and the Chao and Shannon diversities (R2 > 0.5).

Hence, in practical hydrology, it is often crucial to reliably and constantly estimate evapotranspiration. Accordingly, three artificial intelligence (AI) techniques comprising adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), artificial neural network (ANN) and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference-wavelet (ANFIS-Wavelet) were applied in to estimate wheat crop evapotranspiration (ETc). A case study in a Dashtenaz region located in Mazandaran, Iran, was conducted with weather daily data, including the maximum temperature, minimum temperature, maximum relative humidity, minimum relative humidity, wind speed, and solar radiation since 2003 to 2011. The daily climatic data from Dashtenaz stations, (eight stations), were used as inputs AI models for estimating ET0. The assessments of the AI models were compared with the wheat crop evapotranspiration (ETc) values measured by crop coefficient approach and standard FAO-56 Penman–Monteith equation. Similarly, determination coefficient (R2), Nash–Sutcliffe (CNS) efficiency coefficient model and root mean squared error (RMSE) were applied to compare the performance of models and to decide on the best one. The outcomes attained with the ANFIS-Wavelet model (with trapezoidal member function’s combination with Mayer wavelet) were better than ANN and ANFIS models for ETc estimation and confirmed the potential of this technique to provide a useful tool in ETc modeling. © 2019, Int.

In recent years, several water management issues have been addressed by means of models derived from Artificial Intelligence research. When using machine learning based models, the main challenging aspects are represented by the choice of the best possible algorithm, the choice of adequately representative variables and the availability of appropriate data sets. Machine learning algorithms may be a powerful tool for the prediction of actual evapotranspiration, when a time series of few years is available. Starting from the measurements of a sufficient number of climatic parameters it is possible to obtain forecasting models characterized by very high accuracy and precision. Three different evapotranspiration models have been compared in this study. The models differ in the input variables. Four variants of each model were applied, varying the machine learning algorithm: M5P Regression Tree, Bagging, Random Forest and Support Vector Regression. The data refers to an experimental site in Central Florida, characterized by humid subtropical climate. The best outcomes have been provided by Model 1, whose input variables were net solar radiation, sensible-heat flux, moisture content of the soil, wind speed, mean relative humidity and mean temperature. Model 3, built from data only of mean temperature, mean relative humidity and net solar radiation, has provided still satisfactory results.

The FAO Penman–Monteith (FAO-PM) equation has been used as the standard for ET0 estimation. However, the lack of necessary meteorological data makes it difficult to estimate spatially distributed ET0 using the FAO-PM method in the wider ungauged areas. In this study, the aim is to explore the methodology for estimating reference evapotranspiration based on remote sensing data. In this method, remote sensing data are combined with machine learning algorithms to establish a model for spatially distributed ET0 estimation. Three machine learning algorithms were tested, including support vector machine (SVM), back-propagation neural network (BP), and adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). Results showed this method had good ability in estimating ET0. Application of the method in Northwest China indicated that the land surface temperature (LST) can be used to accurately estimate ET0 with high correlation coefficients (r2 of 0.897–0.915). The surface reflectance has potential for estimating ET0 with LST and can slightly improve model accuracy based on LST. Evaluation showed LST was more essential than surface reflectance and the model only based on LST had satisfactory performance.

For this purpose, 12 parameters of monthly climate data were collected and used as input parameters to the models. The parameters were subjected to quality assurance tests to ensure their validity and acceptability. The study was conducted in three sections: (i) Sensitivity analysis was conducted to determine the dominant inputs. (ii) Single models were trained and their performances were accessed on the basis of ET0 derived from pan evaporation method. (iii) Finally, three ensemble methods of simple averaging, weighted averaging and neural ensemble were applied in strategy 1 (for AI models) and strategy 2 (for empirical models) to improve the predicting performance. The results revealed that depending on the climate of the regions, pan evaporation, solar radiation, temperatures and surface pressure are the most dominant parameters, empirical and MLR models could be employed to achieve the valuable results, AI based models are superior in performance to the other models, also promising improvement in ET0 modeling could be achieved by ensemble modeling.

It depends on climatic factors and the influence of these factors on each other makes evapotranspiration estimation difficult. This study attempts to explore the possibility of predicting this important component using three different heuristic methods: support vector machine (SVM), adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and gene expression programming (GEP). In this regard, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) Penman-Monteith equation, the monthly potential evapotranspiration in four synoptic stations (Zahedan, Zabol, Iranshahr, and Chabahar) was calculated using monthly weather data. The weather data were then used as inputs to the SVM, ANFIS and GEP models to estimate potential evapotranspiration. Five different input combinations were tried in the applications. The results of SVM, ANFIS and GEP models were compared based on the coefficient of determination (R                             2                             ), mean absolute error and root mean square error. Findings showed that the SVM model, whose inputs are average air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and sunny hours of the current and one previous month, performed better than the other models for the Zahedan, Zabol, Iranshahr, and Chabahar stations. Comparison of the three heuristic methods indicated that in all stations, the SVM, GEP and ANFIS models took first, second, and third place in estimation of the monthly potential evapotranspiration, respectively.                          © IWA Publishing 2019 Water Supply",Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system; Arid region; Climate parameters; Gene expression programming; Modeling; Support vector machine,Iran; Arid regions; Evapotranspiration; Fuzzy neural networks; Fuzzy systems; Gene expression; Heuristic methods; Heuristic programming; Mean square error; Meteorology; Models; Support vector machines; Water management; Wind; Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system; Average air temperature; Climate parameters; Coefficient of determination; Food and agriculture organizations; Gene expression programming; Penman-Monteith equations; Potential evapotranspiration; algorithm; arid region; comparative study; environmental factor; modeling; potential evapotranspiration; support vector machine; United Nations; adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system; agriculture; air temperature; Article; artificial intelligence; climate; environmental parameters; error; evapotranspiration; fuzzy system; gene expression; gene expression programming; human; humidity; intelligence; intermethod comparison; Iran; kernel method; mean absolute error; radiation; root mean square error; statistical parameters; support vector machine; vapor pressure; water supply; weather; wind speed; Fuzzy inference,Yes,Yes,"weather station, empirical models","climate & meteorology, vegetation indices",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0

The effects of four supervised learning algorithms: Deep Learning-Multilayer Perceptrons (DL), Generalized Linear Model (GLM), Random Forest (RF), and Gradient-Boosting Machine (GBM) and also evaluate the overall ability to predict future ETo. Analysis of these four models, perform in H2O framework. This framework presents a new criterion to train, validate, test and improve the classification efficiency using machine learning algorithms. The performance of the DL model is compared with other state-of-art of models such as RF, GLM and GBM. In this respect, our analysis depicts that models presents high performance for modeling daily ETo (e.g. NSE = 0.95–0.98, r2 = 0.95–0.99, ACC = 85–95, MSE = 0.0369–0.1215, RMSE = 0.1921–0.2691). © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Data analytics; Deep learning; Evapotranspiration; GBM; MissForest,Hoshiarpur; India; Patiala; Punjab [India]; Artificial intelligence; Big data; Decision trees; Deep learning; Evapotranspiration; Irrigation; Water supply; Agricultural industries; Big data applications; Classification efficiency; Data analytics; Generalized linear model; Machine learning research; MissForest; Reference evapotranspiration; agroindustry; algorithm; data acquisition; estimation method; evapotranspiration; genetic algorithm; machine learning; modeling; supervised learning; Learning algorithms,Yes,Yes,Not Specified,"climate & meteorology, vegetation indices",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0

The potential of ANN is investigated in modeling of daily reference evapotranspiration obtained using standard Penman-Monteith equation. The study compares results obtained using mean absolute error, root mean square error, coefficient of determination and Mean absolute percentage error statics used as criteria for evaluation of model performance. The major objective of this study was to estimate daily reference evapotranspiration using an artificial neural network technique with LM, GDM and OSS learning algorithms and compares if a trained neural network with limited input variables can estimate reference evapotranspiration (ETo) efficiently. The comparison results indicate that the LM training function is faster and has a better accuracy than GDM and OSS. The value of coefficient of determination for LM, GDM and OSS function is 0.960, 0.959 and 0.949 respectively. LM produced high value of determination coefficient and lower value of root mean square error rather than other two training functions.

1573,Kelley J.; Pardyjak E.R.,Using neural networks to estimate site-specific crop evapotranspiration with low-cost sensors,2019,10.3390/agronomy9020108,"Irrigation efficiency is facilitated by matching irrigation rates to crop water demand based on estimates of actual evapotranspiration (ET). In production settings, monitoring of water demand is typically accomplished by measuring reference ET rather than actual ET, which is then adjusted approximately using simplified crop coefficients based on calendars of crop maturation. Methods to determine actual ET are usually limited to use in research experiments for reasons of cost, labor and requisite user skill. To pair monitoring and research methods, we co-located eddy covariance sensors with on-farm weather stations over two different irrigated crops (vegetable beans and hazelnuts). Neural networks were used to train a neural network and utilize on-farm weather sensors to report actual ET as measured by the eddy covariance method. This approach was able to robustly estimate ET from as few as four sensor parameters (temperature, solar radiation, humidity and wind speed) with training time as brief as one week. An important limitation found with this machine learning method is that the trained network is only valid under environmental and crop conditions similar to the training period. The small number of required sensors and short training times demonstrate that this approach can estimate site-specific and crop specific ET. With additional field validation, this approach may offer a new method to monitor actual crop water demand for irrigation management. © 2019 by the authors.",Actual evapotranspiration; Irrigation efficiency; Machine learning; Site-specific,,Yes,Yes,"eddy covariance, weather station",climate & meteorology,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

The application of the standard model (FAO-56 Penman-Monteith) to estimate ET0 is restricted due to the absence of required meteorological data. Although many machine learning algorithms have been applied in modeling ET0 with fewer meteorological variables, most of the models are trained and tested using data from the same station, their performances outside the training station are not evaluated. This study aims to investigate generalization ability of the random forest (RF) algorithm in modeling ET0 with different input combinations (refer to different circumstances in missing data), and compares this algorithm with the gene-expression programming (GEP) method using the data from 24 weather stations in a karst region of southwest China. The ET0 estimated by the FAO-56 Penman-Monteith model was used as a reference to evaluate the derived RF-based and GEP-based models, and the coefficient of determination (R2), Nash-Sutcliffe coefficiency of efficiency (NSCE), root of mean squared error (RMSE), and percent bias (PBIAS) were used as evaluation criteria. The results revealed that the derived RF-based generalization ET0 models are successfully applied in modeling ET0 with complete and incomplete meteorological variables (R2, NSCE, RMSE and PBIAS ranged from 0.637 to 0.987, 0.626 to 0.986, 0.107 to 0.563 mm day−1, and −2.916% to 1.571%, respectively), and seven RF-based models corresponding to different incomplete data circumstances are proposed. The GEP-based generalization ET0 models are also proposed, and they produced promising results (R2, NSCE, RMSE and PBIAS ranged from 0.639 to 0.944, 0.636 to 0.942, 0.222 to 0.555 mm day−1, and −1.98% to 0.248%, respectively). Although the RF-based ET0 models performed slightly better than the GEP-based models, the GEP approach has the ability to give explicit expressions between the dependent and independent variables, which is more convenient for irrigators with minimal computer skills. Therefore, we recommend applying the RF-based models in water balance research, and the GEP-based models in agricultural irrigation practice. Moreover, the models performance decreased with periods due to climate change impact on ET0. At last, both of the two methods have the ability to assess the importance of predictors, the order of the importance of meteorological variables on ET0 in Guangxi is: sunshine duration, air temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Climate change impact; Karst region; Variable importance; Water resources,China; Guangxi Zhuangzu; Agriculture; Atmospheric temperature; Climate change; Decision trees; Evapotranspiration; Gene expression; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Mean square error; Object oriented programming; Water management; Water resources; Wind; Agricultural water management; Climate change impact; Coefficient of determination; Gene expression programming; Karst regions; Meteorological variables; Reference evapotranspiration; Variable importances; algorithm; climate change; climate effect; evapotranspiration; hydrological cycle; hydrological modeling; karst; linear programing; machine learning; Penman-Monteith equation; water resource; Climate models,Yes,Yes,"weather station, empirical models","climate & meteorology, vegetation indices",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0

We proposed and tested a single indicator for drainage estimation, the soil drainability index (SDI) based on the near saturated hydraulic conductivity of each layer. We studied rainfall partitioning for eight soils from Brazil and seven different real and generated weather data under scenarios without crop and with a permanent grass cover with three rooting depths, using the HYDRUS-1D model. The SDI showed a good correlation to simulated drainage of the soils. Moreover, well-trained supervised machine-learning methods, including the linear and stepwise linear models (LM, SWLM), besides ensemble regression with boosting and bagging algorithm (ENS-LB, ENS-B), support vector machines (SVMs), and Gaussian process regression (GPR), predicted monthly drainage from bare soil (BS) and grass covered lands (G) using soil–plant–atmosphere parameters (i.e., SDI, monthly precipitation, and evapotranspiration or transpiration).

The FAO-56 Penman-Monteith model is recommended as the reference model to predict ET0, but its application is commonly restricted by lack of complete meteorological data at many worldwide locations. This study evaluated the potential of machine learning models, particularly four relatively simple tree-based assemble algorithms (i.e. random forest (RF), M5 model tree (M5Tree), gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost)), for estimating daily ET0 with limited meteorological data using a K-fold cross-validation method. For assessment of the tree-based models in terms of prediction accuracy, stability and computational costs, these models were further compared with their corresponding support vector machine (SVM) and extreme learning machine (ELM) models. Four input combinations of daily maximum and maximum temperature (Tmax and Tmin), relative humidity (Hr), wind speed (U2), global and extra-terrestrial solar radiation (Rs and Ra) with Tmax, Tmin and Ra as the base dataset were considered using meteorological data during 1961–2010 from eight representative weather stations in different climates of China. The results showed that, when lack of complete meteorological data, the machine learning models using Tmax, Tmin, Hr, U2 and Ra obtained satisfactory ET0 estimates in the temperate continental, mountain plateau and temperate monsoon zones of China (RMSE < 0.5 mm d−1). However, models with three input parameters of Tmax, Tmin and Rs were superior for daily ET0 prediction in the tropical and subtropical zones. The ELM and SVM models offered the best combination of prediction accuracy and stability. The simple tree-based XGBoost and GBDT models showed comparable accuracy and stability to the SVM and ELM models, but exhibited much less computational costs. Considering the complexity level, prediction accuracy, stability and computational costs of the studied models, the XGBoost and GBDT models have been recommended for daily ET0 estimation in different climatic zones of China and maybe elsewhere with similar climates around the world. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Extreme gradient boosting; Gradient boosting decision tree; M5 model tree; Random forest; Reference evapotranspiration,China; algorithm; climate conditions; climate modeling; climate prediction; decision analysis; ensemble forecasting; evapotranspiration; extreme event; machine learning; Penman-Monteith equation; support vector machine,Yes,Yes,"weather station, empirical models","climate & meteorology, vegetation indices",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0
1582,Naidu D.; Majhi B.,Reference evapotranspiration modeling using radial basis function neural network in different agro-climatic zones of chhattisgarh,2019,,"Precise estimation of evapotranspiration (ET) is extremely essential for efficient utilization of available water resources. Among the empirical models, FAO-Penman-Monteith equation (FAO-PM) is considered as standard method to determine reference evapotranspiration (ET0). In developing countries like India, application of FAO-PM equation for ET0 estimation has certain limitations due to unavailability of specific data requirements. Several empirical models such as Hargreaves, Turc, Blaney-Criddle etc., are also considered for ET0 estimation. However, ET0 estimates obtain with these models are not comparable with benchmark FAO-PM ET0.. To address this issue, potential of radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) is investigated to estimate FAO-PM ET0.. Result obtained with proposed RBFNN models are compared with equivalent multi-layer artificial neural network (MLANN) and empirical approach of Hargreaves, Turc and Blaney-Criddle. Lower RMSE values obtained with RBFNN and MLANN models is an indication of improved performance over empirical models. Similarly, higher R2 and Efficiency Factor obtained with RBFNN and MLANN models also approves the superiority of machine learning techniques over empirical models. Among the two machine learning techniques, RBFNN models performed better as compared to MLANN.

In order to improve the accuracy of the ET0 prediction in the hilly area of central Sichuan with missing meteorological data in some area, 15 different prediction models based on multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) were established by using different meteorological factors. The daily meteorological data of 11 representative meteorological stations from 1961 to 2016 were analyzed by the MARS models. These data were divided into training set and test set in a ratio of 7:3, and the simulation results of the MARS models were statistically evaluated using the calculation results of the FAO 56 Penman-Monteith model as a standard. In the statistical evaluation, 4 statistical parameters were obtained by the prediction sequence and the calculation result of the FAO 56 P-M model. They were root mean square error (RMSE), mean relative error (MRE), Nash efficiency coefficient (NSE), and R2. The value of the index above were used to calculate a score for evaluating the prediction accuracy of the models, and rank the models based on the scores. Then the results were compared with other ET0 prediction models and the applicability of the models in the hilly area of central Sichuan was evaluated by the portability analysis. The results showed that the full MARS model with 6 input parameters had the highest accuracy. Decreasing 1 input of relative humidity, the model still had the higher accuracy, ranking No 1 based on comprehensive performance indicator (CPI), which was same with the full model ranking. Reducing continually 1 input of sunshine duration still yielded the high simulation accuracy with NSE and R2 higher than 0.985. Further decreasing 1-2 input, the model NSE and R2 still were higher than 0.9. Among these models, the model with 2 inputs of radiation and wind speed was the most easy to use since the radiation could be calculated and only wind speed was required to measure. Radiation and wind speed were the keys to determine the regional adaptability of machine learning models. Radiation contained the geographic and temporal information of the site, which made it a key factor in the MARS models to distinguish the differences in geographical environment. On the other hand, radiation could compensate for the negative impact caused by the lack of sunshine duration on the prediction accuracy of the MARS models. The wind speed was more important than the other meteorological factors because the response of MARS models were more sensitive to it. Compared with the Irmak-Allen Model, the Irmak Model, and the Hargreaves-M4 Model, the MARS6, MARS7, and MARS8 improve the accuracy. Under the same meteorological factors input, the MARS models had a stronger simulation ability for ET0 than the existing empirical models; Through the portability analysis, the MARS model with 4 input parameters of radiation, maximum and minimum temperature and wind speed maintained high precision with NSE and R2 both higher than 0.985, RMSE 0.121-0.193 mm/d and MRE 2.7%-4.1%. In sum, the MARS model realized the deletion and replacement of meteorological factors, reduced dependence of ET0 forecasting on meteorological data, and maintained a relatively high forecasting accuracy and wide applicability. The MARS was recommended as a reliable ET0 prediction model in the hilly area of central Sichuan. © 2019, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

Machine learning (ML) methods have been extensively used in many disciplines, but so far little work has been performed systematically comparing ML methods for ET retrieval. This paper provides an evaluation of ten ML methods for estimating daily ET based on daily Global LAnd Surface Satellite (GLASS) radiation data and high-level Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data products and ground measured ET data from 184 flux tower sites. Measurements of accuracy (RMSE, R2, and bias) and run time were made for each of ten ML methods with a smaller training data set (n = 7910 data points) and a larger training data set (n= 69,752 data points). Inclusion of more input variables improved algorithm performance but had little effect on run time. The best results were obtained with the larger training data set using the bootstrap aggregation (bagging) regression tree (validation RMSE = 19.91 W/m2) and three hidden layer neural network (validation RMSE = 20.94 W/m2), although the less computationally demanding random kernel (RKS) algorithm also produced good results (validation RMSE = 22.22 W/m2). Comparison of results from sites with different ecosystem types showed the best results for evergreen, shrub, and grassland sites, and the weakest results for wetland sites. Generally, performance was not improved by training with data from only the same ecosystem type. © 2019",Albedo; Bootstrap aggregation tree; Computational efficiency; Evapotranspiration; Flux tower; FPAR; GLASS; Latent heat exchange; Leaf area index; Machine learning; MODIS; Nadir adjusted reflectance; Neural network; Random kernel; Regression tree; Regularized linear regression; Remote sensing; Surface energy balance; Surface radiation; Vegetation index,bootstrapping; efficiency measurement; estimation method; evapotranspiration; latent heat flux; leaf area index; machine learning; MODIS; numerical model; remote sensing; satellite data; terrestrial environment,Yes,Yes,"eddy covariance, remote sensing",climate & meteorology,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Improving on the World Meteorological Organization approved Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), the multi-scalar Standardized Precipitation and Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), a variant of the SPI, is a relatively recent drought index, which takes into account the impacts of temperature change on overall dryness, along with precipitation and evapotranspiration effects. In this paper, an extreme learning machine (ELM) model was applied to predict SPEI in a drought-prone region in eastern Australia, and the quality of the model's performance was compared to that of a multiple linear regression (MLR), an artificial neural network (ANN), and a least support vector regression (LSSVR) model. The SPEI data were derived from climatic variables recorded at six weather stations between January 1915 and December 2012. Model performance was evaluated by means of the normalized root mean square error (NRMSE), normalized mean absolute error (NMAE), coefficients of determination (r2), and the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NASH) in the testing period. Results showed that the ELM and ANN models outperformed the MLR and LSSVR models, and all four models revealed a greater predictive accuracy for the 12-month compared to the 3-month SPEI predictions. For the 12-month SPEI predictions, optimal models had r2 that ranged from 0.668 for the LSSVR model (Station 6) to 0.894 for the ANN model (Station 4). The good agreement between observed and predicted SPEI at different locations within the study region indicated the potential of the developed models to contribute to a more thorough understanding of potential future drought-risks in eastern Australia, and their applicability to drought assessments over multiple timescales.

Here we describe the Transpiration Estimation Algorithm (TEA), which uses both the signals of gross primary productivity and evapotranspiration (ET) to estimate temporal patterns of water use efficiency (WUE, i.e., the ratio between gross primary productivity and T) from which T is calculated. The method first isolates periods when T is most likely to dominate ET. Then, a Random Forest Regressor is trained on WUE within the filtered periods and can thus estimate WUE and T at every time step. Performance of the method is validated using terrestrial biosphere model output as synthetic flux data sets, that is, flux data where WUE dynamics are encoded in the model structure and T is known. TEA reproduced temporal patterns of T with modeling efficiencies above 0.8 for all three models: JSBACH, MuSICA, and CASTANEA. Algorithm output is robust to data set noise but shows some sensitivity to sites and model structures with relatively constant evaporation levels, overestimating values of T while still capturing temporal patterns. The ability to capture between-site variability in the fraction of T to total ET varied by model, with root-mean-square error values between algorithm predicted and modeled T/ET ranging from 3% to 15% depending on the model. TEA provides a widely applicable method for estimating WUE while requiring minimal data and/or knowledge on physiology which can complement and inform the current understanding of underlying processes. ©2018.

Owing to the rapid development of machine learning techniques, a series of powerful tools have been proposed over the past two decades, allowing the scientific community to obtain new insights into the patterns of evapotranspiration (ET) on different spatial scales ranging from ecosystem to global. The primary focus of this study was to investigate the feasibility and effectiveness of both extreme learning machine (ELM) and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) to estimate the daily ET with flux tower observations in four main types of ecosystems. A comparative research was undertaken to evaluate the potential of the models compared with the conventional artificial neural network and support vector machine models. All the developed models were evaluated according to the following performance indices: coefficient of determination (R2), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), root mean square error and mean absolute error. The results showed that all the applied models had high performance for modeling daily ET (e.g., R2 = 0.9398–0.9593 and NSE = 0.8877–0.9147 in forest ecosystem). Among the applied ELM models, the three hybrid ELM methods outperformed the original ELM method in most cases at the four sites and the computational time required for learning these ELM models has been considerably reduced. The subtractive clustering and fuzzy c-means clustering algorithms for ANFIS generally performed better than the grid partitioning algorithm. It was concluded that the advanced ELM and ANFIS models can be recommended as important complements to traditional methods due to their robustness and flexibility. Moreover, significant difference regarding the modeling performance existed among the four major ecosystems types. The models generally achieved the best performance in forest ecosystem, while provided the worst in cropland ecosystem. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system; Eddy covariance; Evapotranspiration; Extreme learning machine; Machine learning; Terrestrial ecosystems,Climate change; Clustering algorithms; Evapotranspiration; Forestry; Fuzzy clustering; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy neural networks; Fuzzy systems; Knowledge acquisition; Learning systems; Mean square error; Adaptive neuro fuzzy inference systems (ANFIS); Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system; Coefficient of determination; Eddy covariance; Extreme learning machine; Fuzzy c-means clustering algorithms; Support vector machine models; Terrestrial ecosystems; agricultural land; air-soil interaction; algorithm; artificial neural network; climate change; eddy covariance; estimation method; evapotranspiration; forest ecosystem; machine learning; numerical method; terrestrial ecosystem; water vapor; Ecosystems,Yes,Yes,eddy covariance,"climate & meteorology, vegetation indices",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0

There are about twenty well-established methods available for ET estimation which depends upon various meteorological parameters and assumptions. Most of these methods are physically based and need a variety of input data. The FAO-56 Penman–Monteith method (PM) for estimating reference evapotranspiration (ET0) is recommend for irrigation scheduling worldwide, because PM generally yields the best results under various climatic conditions. This study investigates the abilities of artificial neural networks (ANN) to improve the accuracy of monthly evaporation estimation in sub-humid climatic region of Dehradun. In the first part of the study, different ANN models, comprising various combinations of training function and number of neutrons were developed to estimate the ET0 and it has been compared with the Penman–Monteith (PM) ET0 as the ideal (observed) ET0. Various statistical approaches were considered to estimate the model performance, i.e. Coefficient of Correlation (r), Sum of Squared Errors, Root Mean Square Error, Nash–Sutcliffe Efficiency Index (NSE) and Mean Absolute Error.

In the subsequent part of the study, the trend analysis of ET0 time series revealed a rising trend in the month of March, and a falling trend during June to November, except August, with more than 90% significance level and the annual declining rate was found to 1.49 mm per year. © 2017, The Author(s).",Evapotranspiration; Mann–Kendall test; Neural networks; Penman–Monteith,Dehradun; Dehradun Valley; India; Uttarakhand; Catchments; Errors; Irrigation; Mean square error; Neural networks; Time series analysis; Water management; Water supply; Artificial neural network modeling; Coefficient of correlation; Doon valleys; Efficiency index; Mann-Kendall test; Neural-networks; Penman Monteith; Penman-Monteith method; Reference evapotranspiration; Sub-humid; accuracy assessment; artificial intelligence; artificial neural network; catchment; correlation; evapotranspiration; hydrological cycle; hydrometeorology; irrigation; Evapotranspiration,Yes,Yes,"weather station, empirical models",climate & meteorology,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

The in situ techniques can measure ET accurately but the observations have limited spatial and temporal coverage. Modeling approaches have been used to estimate ET at broad spatial and temporal scales, while accurately simulating ET at regional scales remains a major challenge. In this study, we upscale ET from eddy covariance flux tower sites to the regional scale with machine learning algorithms. Five machine learning algorithms are employed for ET upscaling including artificial neural network, Cubist, deep belief network, random forest, and support vector machine. The machine learning methods are trained and tested at 36 flux towers sites (65 site years) across the Heihe River Basin and are then applied to estimate ET for each grid cell (1 km × 1 km) within the watershed and for each day over the period 2012–2016. The artificial neural network, Cubist, random forest, and support vector machine algorithms have almost identical performance in estimating ET and have slightly lower root-mean-square error than deep belief network at the site scale. The random forest algorithm has slightly lower relative uncertainty at the regional scale than other methods based on three-cornered hat method. Additionally, the machine learning methods perform better over densely vegetated conditions than barren land or sparsely vegetated conditions. The regional ET generated from the machine learning approaches captured the spatial and temporal patterns of ET at the regional scale. ©2018. American Geophysical Union.

In this context, having a battery of alternative local calibrated ET0 estimation methods is of great interest for any irrigation advisory service. The development of irrigation advisory services will be a major breakthrough for West African agriculture. In the case of many West African countries, the high number of meteorological inputs required by the Penman-Monteith equation has been indicated as constraining. The present paper investigates for the first time in Ghana, the estimation ability of artificial intelligence-based models (Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Gene Expression Programing (GEPs)), and ancillary/external approaches for modeling reference evapotranspiration (ET0) using limited weather data. According to the results of this study, GEPs have emerged as a very interesting alternative for ET0 estimation at all the locations of Ghana which have been evaluated in this study under different scenarios of meteorological data availability. The adoption of ancillary/external approaches has been also successful, moreover in the southern locations.

Recently machine learning (ML) techniques like artificial neural network (ANN) are being widely used for modeling the process of evapotranspiration. However, ANN faces issues like trapping in local minima, slow learning and tuning of meta-parameters. In this study an improved extreme learning machine (ELM) algorithm was used to estimate weekly reference crop evapotranspiration (ETo). The study was carried out for Jodhpur and Pali meteorological weather stations located in the Thar Desert, India. The study evaluated the performance of three different input combinations. The first input combination used locally available maximum and minimum air temperature data while the second and third combination used ETo values from another station (extrinsic inputs) along with the locally available temperature data as inputs. The performance of ELM models was compared with the empirical Hargreaves equation, ANN and least-square support vector machine (LS-SVM) models. Root mean squared error (RMSE), Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient (NSE) and threshold statistics (TS) were used for comparing the performance of the models. The performance of ELM model was found to be better than the Hargreaves and ANN model. The LS-SVM and ELM displayed similar performance. ELM3 models, with 36 and 33 neurons in hidden layer were found to be the best models (RMSE of 0.43 for Jodhpur and 0.33 for Pali station) for estimating weekly ETo at Jodhpur and Pali stations respectively. The results showed that ELM is a simple yet efficient algorithm which exhibited good performance; hence, can be recommended for estimating weekly ETo. Furthermore, it was also found that use of ETo values from another station can help in improving the efficiency of ML models in limited data scenario. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",Arid region; Evapotranspiration; Extreme learning machine; Least square support vector machine; Limited data,India; Jodhpur; Pali; Rajasthan; Thar Desert; Algorithms; Arid regions; Artificial intelligence; Crops; Efficiency; Error statistics; Evapotranspiration; Knowledge acquisition; Learning algorithms; Mean square error; Neural networks; Support vector machines; Extreme learning machine; Hargreaves equations; Least square support vector machines; Limited data; Reference crop evapotranspirations; Root mean squared errors; Temperature data; Weather stations; air temperature; algorithm; arid region; data set; efficiency measurement; evapotranspiration; least squares method; machine learning; performance assessment; support vector machine; water use; weather station; Learning systems,Yes,Yes,"weather station, empirical models","climate & meteorology, vegetation indices",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0

This reserve comprises a set of temporary lakes, often saline, where water level fluctuates seasonally. Water inflows come mainly from direct precipitation and runoffof small lake watersheds. Most of these lakes lack surface outlets and behave as endorheic systems, where water withdrawal is mainly due to evaporation, causing salt accumulation in the lake beds. Remote sensing was used to estimate the temporal variation of the flooded area in these lakes and their associated hydrological patterns related to the seasonality of precipitation and evapotranspiration. Landsat 7 ETM+ satellite images for the reference period 2013-2015 were jointly used with ground-truth datasets. Several inverse modeling methods, such as two-band and multispectral indices, single-band threshold, classification methods, artificial neural network, support vector machine and genetic programming, were applied to retrieve information on the variation of the flooded areas. Results were compared to ground-truth data, and the classification errors were evaluated by means of the kappa coefficient. Comparative analyses demonstrated that the genetic programming approach yielded the best results, with a kappa value of 0.98 and a total error of omission-commission of 2%. The dependence of the variations in the water-covered area on precipitation and evaporation was also investigated. The results show the potential of the tested techniques to monitor the hydrological patterns of temporary lakes in semiarid areas, which might be useful for management strategy-linked lake conservation and specifically to accomplish the goals of both the European Water Framework Directive and the Habitats Directive. © 2016 by the authors.",Genetic programming; Hydrological patterns; Landsat 7; Multispectral indices; Remote sensing; Temporary lakes; Water cover detection,Biospherics; Classification (of information); Environmental regulations; Evaporation; Evapotranspiration; Floods; Genetic algorithms; Genetic programming; Inverse problems; Learning systems; Neural networks; Remote sensing; Saline water; Water conservation; Water levels; Water supply; Classification methods; European Water Framework Directive; Hydrological patterns; Inverse modeling methods; LandSat 7; Machine learning models; Multispectral indices; Water cover; Lakes,Yes,Yes,remote sensing,"climate & meteorology, vegetation indices",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0

This study presents a new method in detection, quantification and prediction of long term land use/cover change of the South Fork Eel River watershed, based on linear conceptual rainfall-runoff modeling and computational intelligence tools. The methodology was presented via a two-phase modeling procedure: event-based and continuous-based modeling phases. In the first phase, a linear conceptual rainfall-runoff model was proposed based on unequal cascade of reservoirs in which the drainage basin was divided into several sub-basins in a sequence based on the stream gauge locations and drainage network. This model includes two parameters of linear reservoir and channel lag times which were computed using relations based on the watershed’s geomorphology. The parameters were calibrated using observed rainfall-runoff events via genetic algorithm. In the second phase, calibrated lag times of events during each month were averaged to produce monthly time series of lag time to be used for training of classic artificial neural network and hybrid Wavelet-ANN for prediction of land use/cover change effect on the watershed’s response in generating runoff. Results indicate the good capability of such two-phase modeling procedure in quantification and prediction of land use change effects on hydrological response of the watershed. Results show, autoregressive and seasonal patterns of lag time, evapotranspiration and temperature are the most important factors which could affect rainfall-runoff modeling of the watershed.

The objective of this research was to evaluate the use of a support vector machine (SVM) to model daily reference evapotranspiration (ET0) using limited climatic data. For the SVM, four combinations of maximum air temperature (Tmax), minimum air temperature (Tmin), wind speed (U2) and daily solar radiation (Rs) in the extremely arid region of Ejina basin, China, were used as inputs with Tmax and Tmin as the base data set. The results of SVM models were evaluated by comparing the output with the ET0 calculated using Penman–Monteith FAO 56 equation (PMF-56). We found that the ET0 estimated using SVM with limited climatic data was in good agreement with those obtained using the conventional PMF-56 equation employing the full complement of meteorological data. In particular, three climatic parameters, Tmax, Tmin, and Rs were enough to predict the daily ET0 satisfactorily. Moreover, the performance of SVM method was also compared with that of artificial neural network (ANN) and three empirical models including Priestley-Taylor, Hargreaves, and Ritchie. The results showed that the performance of SVM method was the best among these models. This offers significant potential for more accurate estimation of the ET0 with scarce data in extreme arid regions. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Extreme arid regions; Limited climatic data; Reference evapotranspiration modeling; Support vector machine,China; Ejina; Nei Monggol; Arid regions; Atmospheric temperature; Evapotranspiration; Information management; Meteorology; Neural networks; Sun; Water resources; Wind; Accurate estimation; Daily solar radiations; Extremely arid regions; Hydrological process; Limited climatic data; Meteorological data; Reference evapotranspiration; Water resources planning and managements; air temperature; arid region; artificial intelligence; evapotranspiration; modeling; Penman-Monteith equation; solar radiation; wind velocity; Support vector machines,Yes,Yes,"weather station, empirical models",climate & meteorology,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

The present study proposed two artificial intelligence models, random forests (RF) and generalized regression neural networks (GRNN), for daily ET0 estimation. Meteorological data including maximum/minimum air temperature, solar radiation, relative humidity, and wind speed during 2009 ∼ 2014 from two stations in southwest China were used to train and test the RF and GRNN models by using two input combinations, including complete data and only temperature and extraterrestrial radiation (Ra) data. The k-fold test was adopted to test the performance of models according to temporal and spatial criteria and data set scanning procedures. The results indicated that both local and external RF and GRNN models performed well for estimating daily ET0, and RF was slightly better than GRNN generally. The high fluctuations in the accuracy ranges justify the importance of applying k-fold test for assessing the model performance, which could avoid drawing partially valid conclusions from model assessments based on simple data set assignment. Overall, both temperature-based RF and GRNN models can accurately estimate daily ET0, which is helpful for irrigation scheduling in southwest China. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Generalized regression neural networks; K-fold test; Modeling; Random forests; Reference evapotranspiration,,Yes,Yes,weather station,"climate & meteorology, vegetation indices",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0

Although the MODIS ET product (MOD16A2) provides viable sources for ET monitoring at 8-day intervals, the spatial resolution (1 km) is too coarse for local scale applications. In this study, we propose a machine learning and spatial temporal fusion (STF)-integrated approach in order to generate 8-day 30 m ET based on both MOD16A2 and Landsat 8 data with three schemes. Random forest machine learning was used to downscale MODIS 1 km ET to 30 m resolution based on nine Landsat-derived indicators including vegetation indices (VIs) and land surface temperature (LST). STF-based models including Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model and Spatio-Temporal Image Fusion Model were used to derive synthetic Landsat surface reflectance (scheme 1)/VIs (scheme 2)/ET (scheme 3) on Landsat-unavailable dates. The approach was tested over two study sites in the United States. The results showed that fusion of Landsat VIs produced the best accuracy of predicted ET (R2 = 0.52–0.97, RMSE = 0.47–3.0 mm/8 days and rRMSE = 6.4–37%). High density of cloud-clear Landsat image acquisitions and low spatial heterogeneity of Landsat VIs benefit the ET prediction. The downscaled 30 m ET had good agreement with MODIS ET (RMSE = 0.42–3.4 mm/8 days, rRMSE = 3.2–26%). Comparison with the in situ ET measurements showed that the downscaled ET had higher accuracy than MODIS ET. © 2017 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

Intelligent irrigation strategy based on regulated deficit irrigation and fuzzy control is a water-saving and energy-efficient method to increase rice yield and quality. Regulated deficit irrigation is a technology that based on the water requirement of rice during different growth stage rather than farmers' experience, which can effectively improve the utilization of water resources. Automatic irrigation system is a time delay and nonlinear process, which is influenced by many factors(temperature, soil moisture, etc.) and is difficult to establish accurate mathematical models, while fuzzy control is an artificial intelligence method that based on the people's experience and imitating people's way of thinking to control complex system with multiple parameters. In this study, the irrigation strategy was composed by fuzzy control module and forecasting irrigation module. Fuzzy irrigation module is a two stage fuzzy control. The first stage fuzzy control determined the optimal current soil moisture. The difference between current soil moisture and optimal current soil moisture, and temperature were taken as input variables for the second stage fuzzy control, to establish the multiple-factor controlled regular database and to realize a fuzzy control of the irrigation time. Soil water loss is mainly caused by evaporation-transpiration and soil water infiltration, which could be estimated by linear regression analysis of environmental parameters. Double loop method was used to measure soil permeability coefficient. The forecasting irrigation module established the soil moisture changing function to forecast when to irrigate by fusing evaporation-transpiration, soil permeability coefficient and meteorological factors. A field research was carried out in Fangzheng County, Heilongjiang Province, and the result showed the water saving rate of regulated deficit irrigation was 20.5%, and the seed setting rate and yield was improved by 4% and 8%, respectively, compared to manual irrigation, which indicated the irrigation strategy used in this study could decrease water waste efficiently and also play critical roles in reducing agriculture production cost, increasing rice yield and improving rice quality. © 2016, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

The objective of the present study was to evaluate the applicability of two different artificial intelligence approaches, including support vector machine (SVM) and artificial neural network optimized by genetic algorithm (GANN), in modeling actual ET in a rainfed maize field under non-mulching (CK) and partial plastic film mulching (MFR). A field experiment was conducted for continuous measurements of ET, meteorological variables, leaf area index (LAI) and plant heights (hc) under both CK and MFR during maize seasons of 2011–2013. The meteorological data containing minimum, maximum, mean air temperature, minimum, maximum, mean relative humidity, solar radiation, wind speed and crop data including LAI and hc during maize growing seasons of 2011–2012 were used to trained the SVM and GANN models by using two different input combination, and data of 2013 were used to validate the performances of the models. The results indicated that SVM1 and GANN1 models with meteorological and crop data as input could accurately estimate maize ET, which confirmed the good performances of SVM and GANN models for maize ET estimation. The performances of SVM2 and GANN2 models only with meteorological data as input were relatively poorer than those of SVM1 and GANN1 models, but the estimated results were acceptable when only meteorological data were available. Due to the optimizing of the genetic algorithm, the GANN models performed a slightly better than the SVM models under both CK and MFR, and can be highly recommended to model ET. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Artificial neural network; Eddy covariance; Evapotranspiration; Maize; Support vector machine,Zea mays; Atmospheric temperature; Crops; Evapotranspiration; Genetic algorithms; Meteorology; Neural networks; Wind; Continuous measurements; Crop evapotranspiration; Eddy covariance; Maize; Mean air temperatures; Meteorological variables; Plastic film mulching; Reference evapotranspiration; agricultural land; agrometeorology; artificial intelligence; artificial neural network; eddy covariance; evapotranspiration; experimental study; genetic algorithm; hydrological modeling; maize; mulching; support vector machine; Support vector machines,Yes,Yes,weather station,"climate & meteorology, vegetation indices, plant physiology",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1

This is attributed partly to the considerable development of machine learning techniques that allow the scientific community to use these advanced tools for approximating the nonlinear processes affecting the variation of water vapor in terrestrial ecosystems. Three novel machine learning approaches, namely, group method of data handling, extreme learning machine (ELM), and adaptive neurofuzzy inference system (ANFIS), were developed to simulate and forecast the daily evapotranspiration (ET) at four different grassland sites based on the flux tower data using the eddy covariance method. These models were compared with the extensively utilized data-driven models, including artificial neural network, generalized regression neural network, and support vector machine (SVM). Moreover, the influences of internal functions on their corresponding models (SVM, ELM, and ANFIS) were investigated together. It was demonstrated that most developed models did good job of simulating and forecasting daily ET at the four sites. In addition to strengths of robustness and simplicity, the newly proposed methods achieved the estimates comparable to those of the conventional approaches and accordingly can be used as promising alternatives to traditional methods. It was further discovered that the generalization performance of the ELM, ANFIS, and SVM models strongly depended on their respective internal functions, especially for SVM. © 2018 Xianming Dou and Yongguo Yang.",,,Yes,Yes,eddy covariance,climate & meteorology,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

In recent years, artificial intelligence methods and wavelet based hybrid model have been used for forecasting of hydrological parameters. In present study the application of the Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) and Wavelet-GPR models to forecast multi step ahead daily (1–30 days ahead) reference evapotranspiration at the synoptic station of Zanjan (Iran) were investigated. For this purpose a 10-year statistical period (2000–2009) was considered, 7 years (2000–2006) for training and the final three years (2007–2009) for testing the various models. Various combinations of input data (various lag times) and different kinds of mother wavelets were evaluated. Results showed that, compared to the GPR model, the hybrid model Wavelet-GPR had greater ability and accuracy in forecasting of daily evapotranspiration. Moreover, the use of yearly lag times in the GPR and wavelet-GPR model increased its accuracy. Investigation of various kinds of mother wavelets also indicated that the Meyer wavelet was the most suitable mother wavelet for forecasting of daily reference evapotranspiration. The results showed that by increasing the forecasting time period from 1 to 30 days, the accuracy of the models is reduced (RMSE = 0.068 mm/day for one day ahead and RMSE = 0.816 mm/day for 30 days ahead). Application of the proposed model to summer season showed that the performance of the model at summer season is better than its performance throughout the year. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.",Forecasting; Gaussian Process regression; Reference crop evapotranspiration; Time series; Wavelet,Iran; Zanjan; Evapotranspiration; Forecasting; Gaussian noise (electronic); Regression analysis; Time series; Water resources; Water supply; Artificial intelligence methods; Daily evapotranspirations; Gaussian process regression; Gaussian process regression model; Reference crop evapotranspirations; Reference evapotranspiration; Water resources management; Wavelet; artificial intelligence; evapotranspiration; forecasting method; Gaussian method; regression analysis; summer; time series analysis; wavelet analysis; Gaussian distribution,Yes,Yes,weather station,climate & meteorology,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Therefore, in the present paper, we propose a new evolving connectionist (ECoS) approaches for modeling daily reference evapotranspiration (ET0) in the Mediterranean region of Algeria. Three ECoS models, namely, (i) the off-line dynamic evolving neural-fuzzy inference system called DEFNIS_OF, (ii) the on-line dynamic evolving neural-fuzzy inference system called DEFNIS_ON, and (iii) the evolving fuzzy neural network called (EFuNN), were statistically compared using the root mean square error (RMSE), the mean absolute error (MAE), the coefficient of correlation (R), and the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) indexes. The proposed approaches were applied for modeling daily ET0 using climatic variables from two weather stations: Algiers and Skikda, Algeria. Five well-known climatic variables were selected as inputs: daily maximum and minimum air temperatures (Tmax and Tmin), daily wind speed (WS), daily relative humidity (RH), and daily sunshine hours (SH). The effect of combining several climatic variables as inputs was evaluated, and at least six scenarios were developed and compared. The proposed ECoS models were compared against the reference Penman-Monteith model referred as “FAO-56 PM”. According to the results obtained, the DEFNIS_OF1 model having Tmax, Tmin, WS, RH, and SH as inputs, is the best model, followed by the DEFNIS_ON1, and the EFuNN1 is the worst model. The R and NSE value calculated for the testing dataset for the Algiers and Skikda stations were (0.954, 0.910) and (0.954, 0.905), respectively. While both DEFNIS_OF1 and DEFNIS_ON1 showed good accuracy and high performances, the EFuNN1 was less accurate. © 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Climatic variables; DENFIS; ECoS; EFuNN; ET<sub>0</sub>                         ; Modeling,Algeria; Artificial Intelligence; Environmental Monitoring; Neural Networks (Computer); Sunlight; Wind; Algeria; Evapotranspiration; Fuzzy logic; Fuzzy neural networks; Fuzzy systems; Mean square error; Models; Statistical tests; Wind; Artificial intelligence techniques; Climatic variables; DENFIS; ECoS; EFuNN; Evolving connectionist systems; Evolving fuzzy neural networks; Neural fuzzy inference systems; artificial intelligence; climate variation; evapotranspiration; modeling; numerical model; air temperature; Algeria; Article; artificial neural network; climate; correlation coefficient; evapotranspiration; feasibility study; fuzzy system; humidity; mathematical variable; measurement accuracy; measurement error; sunlight; wind; artificial intelligence; artificial neural network; environmental monitoring; Fuzzy inference,Yes,Yes,"weather station, empirical models",climate & meteorology,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

Dominant grass and woody species were measured over two growing seasons in each of four study sites that represented the natural factorial combination of mean annual precipitation [wet (750 mm) or dry (450 mm)] and soil type (clay or sand) found in KNP. A machine-learning (random forest) model was used to describe gs as a function of plant type (species or functional group) and site-level environmental parameters (CO2, season, shortwave radiation, soil type, soil moisture, time of day, vapor pressure deficit and wind speed). The model explained 58% of the variance among 6,850 gs measurements. Species, or plant functional group, and shallow (0–20 cm) soil moisture had the greatest effect on gs. Atmospheric drivers and soil type were less important. When parameterized with three years of observed environmental data, the model estimated mean daytime growing season gs as 68 and 157 mmol m-2 sec-1 for grasses and woody plants, respectively. The model produced here could, for example, be used to estimate gs and evapotranspiration in KNP under varying climate conditions. Results from this field-based study highlight the role of species identity and shallow soil moisture as primary drivers of gs in savanna ecosystems of KNP. © 2018 Tobin, Kulmatiski.

In this context, the FAO56 Penman–Montieth (FAO56PM) equation, one of the most accurate equation is used, which however requires a high number of climatic parameters that are not always available for most meteorological stations. The present study measures the effectiveness of selected machine learning techniques [evolutionary regression (ER), artificial neural network (ANN), multi nonlinear regression (MLNR), and support vector machines (SVMs)] for the estimation of ET under limited data conditions. Different models were developed for estimating ET, including various sets of daily climatic variables, namely maximum and minimum air temperature, extraterrestrial radiation, sunshine hours, wind speed and relative humidity Statistical evaluation of different results obtained from selected techniques showed that the best performance was obtained when six meteorological variables, i.e., (Tmax,Tmin,Ra,Sh,Ws,RHmin) were used as input, with highest R2=0.9931 by ANN4 followed by ER4 with R2= 0.9886. The ER and ANN performed similarly though ANN performed slightly better against FAO56PM model. The ER was recommended over ANN because ER gives a physical algebraic expression, which can be further replicated without modelling tools and computers. Further, its gives the intermittent calculation visibility and understanding, also that ER technique is easy to use and more practical in application. However, ANN models need modelling tools and computers with the very skilled user and inside calculations like a black box. ANN also require simulation process to get any output. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.",ANNs; Data-driven techniques; ER; Gamma test technique; MLNR; Reference evapotranspiration; SVMs,accuracy assessment; artificial neural network; estimation method; evapotranspiration; Penman-Monteith equation; regression analysis; support vector machine,Yes,Yes,"weather station, empirical models",climate & meteorology,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

It is a complex process driven mainly by weather parameters, and as such, is characterized by high non-linearity and non-stationarity. This paper introduces a methodology combining wavelet multiresolution analysis with a machine learning algorithm, the multivariate relevance vector machine (MVRVM), in order to predict 16 days of future daily reference evapotranspiration (ETo). This methodology lays the ground for forecasting the spatial distribution of ET using Landsat satellite imagery, hence the choice of 16 days, which corresponds with the Landsat overpass cycle. An accurate prediction of daily ETo is needed to improve the management of irrigation schedules as well as the operations of water supply facilities like canals and reservoirs. In this paper, various wavelet decompositions were performed and combined with MVRVM to develop hybrid models to predict ETo over a 16-days period. These models were compared to a MVRVM model, and models accuracy and robustness were evaluated. The addition of 10 days of forecasted air temperature as additional inputs to the forecasting models was also investigated. The results of the wavelet-MVRVM hybrid modeling methodology showed that a reliable forecast of ETo up to 16 days ahead is possible. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Evapotranspiration; Forecasting; Multivariate relevance vector machine; Wavelet,Artificial intelligence; Evapotranspiration; Irrigation canals; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Reservoirs (water); Satellite imagery; Water supply; Wavelet decomposition; Accurate prediction; Daily evapotranspirations; Hydrological cycles; Irrigation schedule; Multivariate relevance vector machines; Reference evapotranspiration; Wavelet; Wavelet multi-resolution analysis; diurnal variation; evapotranspiration; forecasting method; multivariate analysis; numerical model; support vector machine; wavelet analysis; weather forecasting; Forecasting,Yes,Yes,remote sensing,climate & meteorology,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Air humidity controls vaporisation on earth’s surface and transpiration of plant leaves. Additionally, it prevents most of the radiation from the sun and reflected sun rays from reaching the ground and prevents excessive heating or cooling. The purpose of this study is to predict relative humidity as an important climate parameter, based on annual total precipitation, average ambient temperature, and altitude. Regression and artificial intelligence network models were developed by using monthly average temperature, total precipitation, and altitude parameters obtained from 177 meteorological stations in Turkey to predict relative humidity. When analysed, the model developed with the artificial neural network method had greater predictive power (R2 = 0.84) than the model developed with multiple linear regression (R2 = 0.76).

Various studies have unanimously cited the shortwave incoming radiation (Rs) to be the most robust reference variable explaining the ratio between ETd and ETi. This study aims to contribute in ETi upscaling for global studies using the ratio between daily and instantaneous incoming shortwave radiation (Rsd/Rsi) as a factor for converting ETi to ETd.This paper proposes an artificial neural network (ANN) machine-learning algorithm first to predict RSd from RSi followed by using the RSd/RSi ratio to convert ETi to ETd across different terrestrial ecosystems. Using RSi and RSd observations from multiple sub-networks of the FLUXNET database spread across different climates and biomes (to represent inputs that would typically be obtainable from remote sensors during the overpass time) in conjunction with some astronomical variables (e.g. solar zenith angle, day length, exoatmospheric shortwave radiation), we developed the ANN model for reproducing <i>RSd and further used it to upscale ETi to ETd. The efficiency of the ANN is evaluated for different morning and afternoon times of day, under varying sky conditions, and also at different geographic locations. RS-based upscaled ETd produced a significant linear relation (R2=0.65 to 0.69), low bias (-0.31 to-0.56MJm-2d-1 approx. 4%), and good agreement (RMSE 1.55 to 1.86 MJm-2d-1 approx. 10 %) with the observed ETd, although a systematic overestimation of ETd was also noted under persistent cloudy sky conditions. Inclusion of soil moisture and rainfall information in ANN training reduced the systematic overestimation tendency in predominantly overcast days. An intercomparison with existing upscaling method at daily, 8-day, monthly, and yearly temporal resolution revealed a robust performance of the ANN-driven RS-based ETi upscaling method and was found to produce lowest RMSE under cloudy conditions. Sensitivity analysis revealed variable sensitivity of the method to biome selection and high ETd prediction errors in forest ecosystems are primarily associated with greater rainfall and cloudiness. The overall methodology appears to be promising and has substantial potential for upscaling ETi to ETd for field and regional-scale evapotranspiration mapping studies using polar orbiting satellites. © 2017 The Author(s).",,Climate models; Ecology; Ecosystems; Evapotranspiration; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Mapping; Neural networks; Rain; Sensitivity analysis; Silicon; Soil moisture; Artificial neural network approach; Daily evapotranspirations; Geographic location; Polar-orbiting satellites; Remote sensing applications; Short-wave radiation; Temporal resolution; Terrestrial ecosystems; algorithm; artificial neural network; evapotranspiration; forest ecosystem; machine learning; remote sensing; satellite altimetry; sensitivity analysis; sensor; shortwave radiation; soil moisture; upscaling; Remote sensing,Yes,Yes,remote sensing,"climate & meteorology, vegetation indices, soil",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0

Numerous factors have been related to variations of soil salinity, some of them combined empirical mode decomposition (EMD) method and correlation analysis. However, environmental factors that essentially affect soil-water balance are not given enough attention. In addition, further analysis is needed in exploring how well the environmental factors can interpret the variations in soil salinity at different scales, especially in arid oasis areas and at large scales. This paper explores the potential of modeling variations in soil salinity via the EMD and Random Forest modeling of remote sensing based environmental factors. A case study is presented for Tarim basin, Xinjiang, China, using land surface temperature (LST), evapotranspiration (ET), TRMM precipitation (TRM) and digital elevation model (DEM) products. Soil salinity and its decompositions were first correlated with environmental factors for feature selection. Then, those selected environmental factors and their decompositions were correlated and coupled with their counterparts of soil salinity to evaluate their synchronization. Finally, those IMF components of environmental factors that had high correlation coefficients and were coupled well with corresponding IMF components of soil salinity were identified and divided into different feature sets for modeling. Mean absolute error and mean bias error were adopted for accuracy assessment of the models. Our results indicate that soil salinity series can be separated into eight scales ranging from 170 km to 480 km. IMF components 5–7 account for most of the variation and can be modeled using the corresponding IMF components of different combinations of DEM, ET, LST and TRM. IMF components 6–7 are well coupled with LST and ET at approximately 475 km scale. Overall, regional-scale modeling of variations in soil salinity based on remote sensing products is possible. Reasonably accurate results can be obtained in arid oasis areas where researchers and policy makers must focus on preventing the loss of agricultural productivity and ecosystem health. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Correlation; Coupling; Empirical mode decomposition; Random Forest; Remote sensing,China; Tarim Basin; Xinjiang Uygur; Atmospheric temperature; Correlation methods; Couplings; Decision trees; Decomposition; Ecology; Ecosystems; Factor analysis; Productivity; Remote sensing; Signal processing; Soil moisture; Surveying; Agricultural productivity; Correlation coefficient; Digital elevation model; Empirical Mode Decomposition; Environmental factors; Land surface temperature; Random forest modeling; Random forests; arid environment; correlation; decomposition analysis; empirical analysis; environmental factor; machine learning; numerical model; oasis; remote sensing; salinization; soil water; spatial variation; Soils,Yes,Yes,remote sensing,"climate & meteorology, vegetation indices",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0

Eleven indicators including albedo, land surface temperature (LST), and vegetation indices (VIs) derived from Landsat 8 data were first upscaled to 1 km resolution. Machine learning algorithms including Support Vector Regression (SVR), Cubist, and Random Forest (RF) were used to model the relationship between the Landsat indicators and MODIS 8-day 1 km ET. The models were then used to predict 30 m ET based on Landsat 8 indicators. A total of thirty-two pairs of Landsat 8 images/MODIS ET data were evaluated at four study sites including two in United States and two in South Korea. Among the three models, RF produced the lowest error, with relative Root Mean Square Error (rRMSE) less than 20%. Vegetation greenness related indicators such as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), and vegetation moisture related indicators such as Normalized Difference Infrared Index-Landsat 8 OLI band 7 (NDIIb7) and Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) were the five most important features used in RF model. Temperature-based indicators were less important than vegetation greenness and moisture-related indicators because LST could have considerable variation during each 8-day period. The predicted Landsat downscaled ET had good overall agreement with MODIS ET (average rRMSE = 22%) and showed a similar temporal trend as MODIS ET. Compared to the MODIS ET product, the downscaled product demonstrated more spatial details, and had better agreement with in situ ET observations (R2 = 0.56). However, we found that the accuracy of MODIS ET was the main control factor of the accuracy of the downscaled product. Improved coarse-resolution ET estimation would result in better finer-resolution estimation. This study proved the potential of using machine learning approaches for ET downscaling considering their effectiveness and ease of implementation.

Eight global climate model (GCM) outputs retrieved from the Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) were employed to downscale monthly ET0 for the historical period 1960-2005 as a validation approach and for the future period 2010-2099 as a projection of ET0 under the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios. The following conclusions can be drawn: the ELM and SVR methods demonstrate a very good performance in estimating Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)-56 Penman-Monteith ET0. Variation in future ET0 mainly occurs in the spring and autumn seasons, while the summer and winter ET0 changes are moderately small. Annually, the ET0 values were shown to increase at a rate of approximately 7.5 mm, 7.5 mm, 0.0mm(8.2 mm, 15.0 mm, 15.0 mm) decade-1, respectively, for the near-term projection (2010-2039), mid-term projection (2040-2069), and long-term projection (2070-2099) under the RCP4.5 (RCP8.5) scenario. Compared to the historical period, the relative changes in ET0 were found to be approximately 2%, 5% and 6% (2%, 7% and 13%), during the near, mid- and long-term periods, respectively, under the RCP4.5 (RCP8.5) warming scenarios.

Since agriculture represents 70% of Brazil’s water consumption, adequate and efficient application of water may reduce the conflicts over the use of water among the multiple users. Considering the importance of accurate estimation of evapotranspiration, the objective of the present study was to model and compare the reference evapotranspiration from different heuristic methodologies. The standard Penman-Monteith method was used as reference for evapotranspiration, however, to evaluate the heuristic methodologies with scarce data, two widely known methods had their performances assessed in relation to Penman-Monteith. The methods used to estimate evapotranspiration from scarce data were Priestley-Taylor and Thornthwaite. The computational techniques Stepwise Regression (SWR), Random Forest (RF), Cubist (CB), Bayesian Regularized Neural Network (BRNN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) were used to estimate evapotranspiration with scarce and full meteorological data. The results show the robustness of the heuristic methods in the prediction of the evapotranspiration. The performance criteria of machine learning methods for full weather data varied from 0.14 to 0.22 mm d-1 for mean absolute error (MAE), from 0.21 to 0.29 mm d-1 for root mean squared error (RMSE) and from 0.95 to 0.99 coefficient of determination (r²).

Moreover, other methods such as empirical equations and artificial intelligence methods can be used to model ET. In the recent years, artificial intelligence methods have been widely utilized to estimate reference evapotranspiration (ETo). In the present study, local and external performances of multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) and gene expression programming (GEP) were assessed for estimating daily ETo. For this aim, daily weather data of six stations with different climates in Iran, namely Urmia and Tabriz (semi-arid), Isfahan and Shiraz (arid), Yazd and Zahedan (hyper-arid) were employed during 2000–2014. Two types of input patterns consisting of weather data-based and lagged ETo data-based scenarios were considered to develop the models. Four statistical indicators including root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), coefficient of determination (R2), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) were used to check the accuracy of models. The local performance of models revealed that the MARS and GEP approaches have the capability to estimate daily ETo using the meteorological parameters and the lagged ETo data as inputs. Nevertheless, the MARS had the best performance in the weather data-based scenarios. On the other hand, considerable differences were not observed in the models’ accuracy for the lagged ETo data-based scenarios. In the innovation of this study, novel hybrid models were proposed in the lagged ETo data-based scenarios through combination of MARS and GEP models with autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (ARCH) time series model. It was concluded that the proposed novel models named MARS-ARCH and GEP-ARCH improved the performance of ETo modeling compared to the single MARS and GEP. In addition, the external analysis of the performance of models at stations with similar climatic conditions denoted the applicability of nearby station’ data for estimation of the daily ETo at target station. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Estimation; FAO Penman-Monteith; Gene expression programming; Multivariate adaptive regression splines; Reference evapotranspiration,East Azerbaijan; Fars; Iran; Orumiyeh; Shiraz; Sistan va Baluchestan; Tabriz; West Azerbaijan; Yazd; Zahedan; Arches; Artificial intelligence; Errors; Estimation; Evapotranspiration; Genes; Mean square error; Meteorology; Scheduling; Water management; Agricultural water management; Artificial intelligence methods; Autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity; Fao penman monteiths; Gene expression programming; Mean absolute percentage error; Multivariate adaptive regression splines; Reference evapotranspiration; estimation method; evapotranspiration; genetic algorithm; innovation; irrigation system; multivariate analysis; numerical model; Penman-Monteith equation; regression analysis; software; time series; water management; Gene expression,Yes,Yes,"weather station, load cells","climate & meteorology, vegetation indices",0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0

However, they are often limited in their ability to provide reliable spatial distribution data for soil moisture due to their coarse spatial resolutions. In this study, three machine learning approaches—random forest, boosted regression trees, and Cubist—were examined for the downscaling of AMSR-E soil moisture (25 × 25 km) data over two regions (South Korea and Australia) with different climatic characteristics using moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer products (1 km), including surface albedo, land surface temperature (LST), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, Enhanced Vegetation Index, Leaf Area Index, and evapotranspiration (ET). Results showed that the random forest approach was superior to the other machine learning models for downscaling AMSR-E soil moisture data in terms of the correlation coefficient [r = 0.71/0.84 (South Korea/Australia) for random forest, 0.75/0.77 for boosted regression trees, and 0.70/0.61 for Cubist] and root-mean-square error (RMSE = 0.049/0.057, 0.052/0.078, and 0.051/0.063, respectively) through cross-validation. The ET and LST were identified as the most influential among the six input parameters when estimating AMSR-E soil moisture for South Korea, while ET, albedo, and LST were very useful for Australia. In overall, the downscaled soil moisture with 1 km resolution yielded a higher correlation with in situ observations than the original AMSR-E soil moisture data. The latter appeared higher than the downscaled data in forested areas, possibly due to the overestimation of soil moisture by passive microwave sensors over forests, which implies that downscaling can mitigate such overestimation of soil moisture. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",AMSR-E; Boosted regression trees; Cubist; Downscaling; MODIS; Random forest; Soil moisture,Australia; South Korea; Artificial intelligence; Decision trees; Forestry; Learning systems; Mean square error; Microwave sensors; Moisture control; Radiometers; Regression analysis; Satellite imagery; Soil moisture; Solar radiation; Vegetation; Boosted regression trees; Cubist; Down-scaling; MODIS; Random forests; AMSR-E; downscaling; forest ecosystem; land surface; machine learning; MODIS; NDVI; regression analysis; remote sensing; soil moisture; spatial distribution; surface temperature; Soil surveys,Yes,Yes,remote sensing,"climate & meteorology, vegetation indices, soil",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0

The meteorological data and crop data including LAI and hc from 2011 to 2012 were used to train the ELM and GRNN using two different input combinations. The performances of ELM and GRNN were compared with the modified dual crop coefficient (Kc) approach in 2013. Results indicated that ELM1 and GRNN1 using meteorological and crop data as inputs estimated maize ET accurately, with root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.221 mm/d, mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.203 mm/d, and NS of 0.981 for ELM1, RMSE of 0.225 mm/d, MAE of 0.211 mm/d, and NS of 0.981 for GRNN1, respectively, which confirmed better performances than the modified dual Kc model.

Conversely, to know a crop's consumptive water use, one must know its exact evapotranspiration (ET) rate.

In this study, sixteen remote sensing based drought factors from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite sensors were used to monitor meteorological and agricultural drought during 2000-2012 growing seasons for different climate regions in the USA. Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) with time scales from 1 to 12 months and crop yield data were used as reference data of meteorological and agricultural drought, respectively. The relationship between sixteen remote sensing based drought factors and in situ reference data was modeled through three machine learning approaches: random forest, boosted regression trees, and Cubist, which have proved to be robust and flexible in many regression tasks. Results showed that random forest produced the best performance (R2=0.93, RMSE=0.3) for SPI prediction among the three approaches. Land surface-related drought factors, e.g., Land Surface Temperature (LST) and Evapotranspiration (ET) showed higher relative importance for short-term meteorological drought while vegetation-related drought factors, e.g., Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Normalized Multi-band Drought Index (NMDI) showed higher relative importance for long-term meteorological drought by random forest. Six drought factors were selected based on the relative importance by their category to develop drought indicators that represent meteorological and agricultural drought by using the relative importance as weights. While TRMM showed higher relative importance for meteorological drought, LST and NDVI showed higher relative importance for agricultural drought in the arid and humid regions, respectively. Finally, drought distribution maps were produced using the drought indicators and compared with the U.S. Drought Monitor (USDM) maps, which showed a strong visual agreement. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",Boosted regression trees; Cubist; Drought monitoring; MODIS; Random forest; TRMM,climate change; environmental factor; evapotranspiration; land surface; machine learning; MODIS; NDVI; performance assessment; regression analysis; remote sensing; sensor; visual analysis,Yes,Yes,"weather station, remote sensing","climate & meteorology, vegetation indices",0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0

This study therefore aims to determine the possibility of drought, its frequency, persistence and severity in Southwest Nigeria. The study employs the use of secondary data such as rainfall records from Ijebu-Ode station covering a period of 40 years (1974-2013) for drought computation while other parameters such as temperature, potential evapotranspiration and relative humidity were used for Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based modeling and prediction of drought. The frequency of drought events was calculated using the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI). The SPI was calculated for 3, 6, 9, 12, and 24 months’ time steps, and findings shows that all time steps had an increasing trend which signify excess rainfall and flooding in years to come except, the 3 month time step for the month of April that shows a significant decreasing trend, indicating an increase in drought. ANN was further used to model the drought for the 3-month time step for the month of April. Prediction of the year 2045 shows that there would be periods of severe dryness. The study concludes that the hypothesis of increasing rainfall in the tropics due to climate change does not hold for all areas and time steps, since there is indication that drought will persist in few months in years to come. Finally, more intensive study should be done to ascertain possibility of unforeseen droughts in the tropics where rainfall has been forecasted to persist. © 2017 Journal of Urban and Environmental Engineering (JUEE).

Hydro-climatic drivers causing the changes in drained wetlands were identified and used to develop a generic model to predict wetland ET. Eddy covariance (EC)-based ET measurements were made for two years at two differently drained but close by wetlands, a heavily drained wetland (SW) (97% reduced surface storage) and a more functional wetland (DW) (42% reduced storage). Annual ET for more intensively drained SW was 836 mm, 34% less than DW (1271 mm) and the difference was significant (p = 0.001). This difference was mainly due to drainage driven differences in inundation and associated effects on net radiation (Rn) and local relative humidity. Two generic daily ET models, a regression model (MSE = 0.44 mm2, R2 = 0.80) and a machine learning-based Relevance Vector Machine (RVM) model (MSE = 0.36 mm2, R2 = 0.84), were developed with the latter being more robust. The RVM model can predict changes in ET for different restoration scenarios; a 1.1 m rise in drainage level showed 7% increase ET (18 mm) at SW while the increase at DW was negligible. The additional ET, 28% of surface flow, can enhance water storage, flood protection, and climate mitigation services at SW compared to DW. More intensely drained wetlands at higher elevation should be targeted for restoration for enhanced storage through increased ET. The models developed can predict changes in ET for improved evaluation of basin-scale effects of restoration programs and climate change scenarios. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",Eddy covariance; Flood protection; Inundation; MIKE SHE; Relevance vector machine; Wetland hydration,Artificial intelligence; Climate change; Drainage; Evapotranspiration; Flood control; Floods; Forecasting; Learning systems; Radiation effects; Regression analysis; Restoration; Water supply; Wetlands; Eddy covariance; Flood protection; Inundation; MIKE SHE; Relevance Vector Machine; climate change; drainage; eddy covariance; evapotranspiration; flood control; hydrological modeling; hydrological regime; relative humidity; wetland; Climate models,Yes,Yes,eddy covariance,"climate & meteorology, vegetation indices",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0

Process-based algorithms have been widely used to estimate global terrestrial ET, yet each ET individual algorithm has exhibited large uncertainties. In this study, the support vector machine (SVM) method was introduced to improve global terrestrial ET estimation by integrating three process-based ET algorithms: MOD16, PT-JPL and SEMI-PM. At 200 FLUXNET flux tower sites, we evaluated the performance of the SVM method and others, including the Bayesian model averaging (BMA) method and the general regression neural networks (GRNNs) method together with three process-based ET algorithms. We found that the SVM method was superior to all other methods we evaluated. The validation results showed that compared with the individual algorithms, the SVM method driven by tower-specific (Modern Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, MERRA) meteorological data reduced the root mean square error (RMSE) by approximately 0.20 (0.15) mm/day for most forest sites and 0.30 (0.20) mm/day for most crop and grass sites and improved the squared correlation coefficient (R2) by approximately 0.10 (0.08) (95% confidence) for most flux tower sites. The water balance of basins and the global terrestrial ET calculation analysis also demonstrated that the regional and global estimates of the SVM-merged ET were reliable.

A prediction model of an improved Online Sequential Extreme Learning Machine (IOS-ELM) of daily reference crop evapotranspiration is therefore examined in this paper. The different manipulation of the inverse of the matrix is made according to the optimal solution and using a regularization factor at the same time in the model. The flexibility of the IOS-ELM in ET0 modeling was assessed using the original meteorological data (Tmax, Tm, Tmin, n, Uh, RHm, φ, Z) of the years 1971–2014 in Yulin, Ankang, Hanzhong, and Xi’an of Shaanxi, China. Those eight parameters were used as the input, while the reference evapotranspiration values were the output. In addition, the ELM, LSSVM, Hargreaves, Priestley-Taylor, Mc Cloud and IOS-ELM models were tested against the FAO-56 PM model by the performance criteria. The experimental results demonstrate that the performance of IOS-ELM was better than the ELM and LSSVM and significantly better than the other empirical models. Furthermore, when the total ET0 estimation of the models was compared by the relative error, the results of the intelligent algorithms were better than empirical models at rates lower than 5%, but the gross ET0 empirical models mainly had 12% to 64.60% relative error.

In addition, ETo is vital for calculating the agricultural demand. In fact, Penman-Monteith (PM) method is considered as reference method for estimating (ETo), however, this method required a lot of data to be used which is not usually available in many catchment areas. Furthermore, there are several efforts that have been performed as competitor to reach accurate estimation of (ETo) when there is lack of data to utilize (PM) method, but still required numerous research. Recently, methods based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) have been suggested to provide reliable prediction model for several application in engineering and especially for hydrological process. However, time series prediction based on Artificial Neural Network (ANN) learning algorithms is fundamentally difficult and faces problem. One of the major shortcomings is that the ANN model experiences over-fitting problem during training session and also occurs when a neural network loses its generalization. In this research a modification for the classical Multi Layer Preceptron- Artificial Neural Network (MLP-ANN) modeling namely; Ensemble Neural Network (ENN) is proposed and applied for predicting daily ETo. The proposed model applied at two different region with two different climatic conditions, Rasht city located north part of Iran and Johor Bahru City, Johor, Malaysia using maximum and minimum daily temperature collected from 1975 to 2005. The result showed that the ENN outperformed the classical MLP-ANN method and successfully predict daily ETo utilizing maximum and minimum temperature only with satisfactory level of accuracy.

Further, it is very usual that this assignment is defined according to a local and temporary criterion, i.e. the models are trained and tested using data of the same station. Based on this procedure, the performance of the models outside the training location cannot be inferred. The present work evaluates the performance of Gene Expression Programming (GEP) based models for estimating reference evapotranspiration (ET0) according to temporal and spatial criteria and data set scanning procedures in coastal environments of Iran. The accuracy differences between the local and the external performance depend on the specific climatic trends of the test stations, as well as on the input combination used to feed the models. When relying on a suitable input selection, externally trained models might be a valid alternative to locally trained ones, which would be a crucial advantage in places where only limited climatic variables are available. K-fold testing is a good choice to prevent partially valid conclusions derived from model assessments based on a simple data set assignment. Further, calibration of the GEP model may not be needed, if enough climatic data are available at other stations for external model application. The performance of the GEP model fluctuates chronologically and spatially. A suitable assessment of the model should consider a complete local and/or external scan of the data set used. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",Evapotranspiration; Exogenous data; Gene Expression Programming; Local training,Iran; Artificial intelligence; Evapotranspiration; Water supply; Coastal environments; Data mining applications; Exogenous data; Gene expression programming; Local training; Performance assessment; Reference evapotranspiration; Temporal and spatial; artificial intelligence; climate variation; coastal zone; data mining; data set; diurnal variation; evapotranspiration; gene expression; performance assessment; Statistical tests,Yes,Yes,Not Specified,"climate & meteorology, vegetation indices",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0

Limited temporal resolution of satellite images and cloudy skies present major limitations that impede continuous estimates of ET. This study introduces a practical approach that overcomes (in part) the previous limitations by implementing machine learning techniques that are accurate and robust. The analysis was applied to the Canal B service area of the Delta Canal Company in central Utah using data from the 2009-2011 growing seasons. Actual ET was calculated by an algorithm using data from satellite images. A relevance vector machine (RVM), which is a sparse Bayesian regression, was used to build a spatial model for ET. The RVM was trained with a set of inputs consisting of vegetation indexes, crops, and weather data. ET estimated via the algorithm was used as an output. The developed RVM model provided an accurate estimation of spatial ET based on a Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient (E) of 0.84 and a root-mean-squared error (RMSE) of 0.5 mm day-1. This methodology lays the groundwork for estimating ET at a spatial scale for the days when a satellite image is not available. It could also be used to forecast daily spatial ET if the vegetation indexes model inputs are extrapolated in time and the reference ET is forecasted accurately. © 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Evapotranspiration; Irrigation efficiency; Mapping evapotranspiration at high resolution with internalized calibration (METRIC); Relevance vector machine; Remote sensing,United States; Utah; Evapotranspiration; Hydraulic structures; Learning systems; Mean square error; Satellites; Vegetation; High resolution; Irrigation efficiency; Machine learning techniques; Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient; Relevance Vector Machine; Root mean squared errors; Sparse Bayesian regression; Water resources planning and managements; algorithm; artificial intelligence; calibration; evapotranspiration; irrigation; remote sensing; satellite imagery; Remote sensing,Yes,Yes,remote sensing,"climate & meteorology, vegetation indices",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0

Artificial intelligence-based methods may provide reliable prediction models for several applications in engineering. However, time-series prediction based on artificial neural network (ANN) learning algorithms is fundamentally problematic. For example, the ANN model can experience over-fitting during training and, in consequence, lose its generalization. In this research, several over-fitting procedures have been augmented with the classical ANN model, are proposed. This model was applied to the prediction of the daily ETo at Rasht city, located in the north part of Iran, by using the minimum and maximum daily temperature of the region collected from 1975-1988. In addition, three different scenarios have been developed in order to achieve better prediction accuracy. The results showed that the proposed ENN model successfully predicted the daily ETo with a significant level of accuracy using only the maximum and minimum temperatures. The model also outperformed the classical ANN method. In addition, the proposed ENN compared with Hargreaves and Samani (Appl Eng Agric 1:96-99, 1985) (HGS) model and showed the ENN provides more accurate prediction for ETo. Furthermore, the proposed model could provide relatively good level of accuracy when examined for multi-lead predictions, which could not be afford by HGS model. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Ensemble neural network; Evapotranspiration; Neural network; Over-fitting; Rasht City (Iran),Gilan; Iran; Rasht; Forecasting; Mathematical models; Neural networks; Water supply; Accurate prediction; Ensemble neural network; Maximum and minimum temperatures; Overfitting; Penman-Monteith method; Rasht City (Iran); Reference evapotranspiration; Time series prediction; artificial intelligence; artificial neural network; ensemble forecasting; evapotranspiration; numerical model; prediction; Evapotranspiration,Yes,Yes,empirical models,climate & meteorology,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

Environmental thermal gradients often interfere with Granier sap flow measurements since this method uses heat as a tracer, thus introducing a bias in transpiration flux calculation. The FAUSY algorithm is applied to solve measurement problems and provides an approximate and yet effective way of finding the relationship between the environmental variables and the natural temperature gradient (NTG), which is too complex or too ill-defined for precise mathematical analysis. In the process, FAUSY extracts the relationships from a set of input-output environmental observations, thus general directions for algorithm-based machine learning in fuzzy systems are outlined. Through an iterative procedure, the algorithm plays with the learning or forecasting via a simulated model. After a series of error control iterations, the outcome of the algorithm may become highly refined and be able to evolve into a more formal structure of rules, facilitating the automation of Granier sap flow data analysis. The system presented herein simulates the occurrence of NTG with reasonable accuracy, with an average residual error of 2.53% for sap flux rate, when compared to data processing performed in the usual way. For practical applications, this is an acceptable margin of error given that FAUSY could correct NTG errors up to an average of 76% of the normal manual correction process. In this sense, FAUSY provides a powerful and flexible way of establishing the relationships between the environment and NTG occurrences. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",Fuzzy rule; Granier method; Machine learning; Plant transpiration; Sap flow measurement,Computer simulation; Data processing; Flow measurement; Fuzzy rules; Intelligent systems; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Thermal gradients; Transpiration; Environmental observation; Environmental variables; Fuzzy logic algorithms; Granier method; Mathematical analysis; Measurement problems; Plant transpiration; Sap flow measurements; accuracy assessment; algorithm; data interpretation; error analysis; evergreen tree; fuzzy mathematics; mathematical analysis; numerical model; sap flow; temperature gradient; transpiration; Iterative methods,Yes,Yes,"remote sensing, sap flow","climate & meteorology, vegetation indices, plant physiology",0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1

Due to its importance, several direct and indirect methods have been employed to determine the reference crop evapotranspiration but success has been limited because the direct measurement methods lack in precision and accuracy due to scale issues and other problems, while some of the more accurate indirect methods, e.g. the Penman-Monteith benchmark model, are extremely non-linear and require weather input data that are not routinely monitored. In such situations, artificial intelligence (AI), neural computing techniques that are able to accurately map complex, non-linear input-output relationships offer a useful alternative. This paper has used the Kohonen Self-Organizing Map (SOM), unsupervised artificial neural networks, to develop prediction models for the ET o. This was achieved by using the powerful clustering capability of the SOM to analyze the multi-dimensional data array comprising the estimated ET o (based on the FAO Penman-Monteith model) and different subsets of climatic variables known to affect it. The findings indicate that the SOM-based ET o estimates, even when forced with fewer input data variables, were in good agreement with those obtained using the conventional FAO Penman-Monteith formulation employing the full complement of weather data. Further comparisons were carried out between the SOM model estimates of the ET o and those based on the use of feed-forward back propagation supervised artificial neural networks and the results showed that the SOM estimates were superior. Finally, the SOM-based estimates were also found to be significantly superior to those estimated using established empirical ET o methods recommended in the literature for situations where the full complement of input weather needed to drive the Penman-Monteith model are unavailable. This offers significant potential for more accurate estimation of the ET o in data scarce regions of the world. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",Artificial intelligence models; Crop water requirements; FAO Penman-Monteith method; Kohonen self-organizing map; Neural networks; Reference crop evapotranspiration,Conformal mapping; Crops; Estimation; Evapotranspiration; Input output programs; Irrigation; Mathematical models; Rain; Runoff; Scheduling; Water management; Water supply; Accurate estimation; Benchmark models; Climatic variables; Crop evapotranspiration; Crop water requirements; Direct and indirect methods; Direct measurement method; FAO Penman-Monteith method; Feed-forward back propagation; Indirect methods; Input datas; Input-output; Irrigation water management; Kohonen self-organizing map; Kohonen self-organizing maps; Model estimates; Multidimensional data; Neural computing; Penman-Monteith; Prediction model; Rainfall-runoff modeling; Reference crop evapotranspiration; Weather data; Weather inputs; accuracy assessment; artificial intelligence; artificial neural network; benchmarking; climate conditions; cluster analysis; crop plant; empirical analysis; evapotranspiration; irrigation system; precision; rainfall-runoff modeling; water management; water resource; water use; Neural networks,Yes,Yes,empirical models,"climate & meteorology, vegetation indices",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0

In this study we present a machine learning model that serves as a spatial guide and allows forest managers to focus their existing detection and monitoring efforts on key areas and proactively adopt the most appropriate course of intervention. We implemented the random forest model within a spatial framework to determine which pine forests in Mpumalanga are highly susceptible to S. noctilio infestations. Results indicate that a majority (63%) of pine forest plantations located in Mpumalanga have a high susceptibility (>70%) to S. noctilio infestation. A KHAT value of 0.84 and F measures above 0.87 indicate that the random forest model is a robust classifier that produces accurate results. Additionally, the use of the backward variable selection method enabled us to simplify the random forest modeling process and identify the minimum number of explanatory variables that offer the best discriminatory power and help in the empirical interpretation of the final random forest model.

The estimates of the ANN and ANFIS models were compared with the garlic crop evapotranspiration (ETc) values measured by lysimeter and those of the crop coefficient approach. Based on these comparisons, it can be concluded that the ANN and ANFIS techniques are suitable for simulation of ETc. © 2011 American Society of Civil Engineers.",ANFIS; ANN; Garlic reference evapotranspiration; Modeling.,Hamadan; Iran; Allium sativum; Arid regions; Atmospheric humidity; C (programming language); Crops; Estimation; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy systems; Lysimeters; Network architecture; Neural networks; Scheduling; Soil surveys; Sun; Water supply; Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system; ANFIS; ANFIS model; ANN; Artificial Neural Network; Crop coefficient; Crop evapotranspiration; Crop water requirements; Environmental assessment; Garlic reference evapotranspiration; Irrigation scheduling; Maximum temperature; Modeling.; Performance evaluation; Relative humidities; Semi-arid region; Water resources management; Wind speed; artificial neural network; computer simulation; crop production; environmental assessment; estimation method; evapotranspiration; fuzzy mathematics; irrigation; lysimeter; numerical model; performance assessment; water management; Evapotranspiration,Yes,Yes,load cells,climate & meteorology,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
2042,Torres A.F.; Walker W.R.; McKee M.,Forecasting daily potential evapotranspiration using machine learning and limited climatic data,2011,10.1016/j.agwat.2010.10.012,"Anticipating, or forecasting near-term irrigation demands is a requirement for improved management of conveyance and delivery systems. The most important component of a forecasting regime for irrigation is a simple, yet reliable, approach for forecasting crop water demands, which in this paper is represented by the reference or potential evapotranspiration (ETo). In most cases, weather data in the area is limited to a reduced number of variables measured, therefore current or future ETo estimation is restricted. This paper summarizes the results of testing of two proposed forecasting ETo schemes under the mentioned conditions. The first or "" direct"" approach involved forecasting ETo using historically computed ETo values. The second or "" indirect"" approach involved forecasting the required weather parameters for the ETo calculation based on historical data and then computing ETo. An statistical machine learning algorithm, the Multivariate Relevance Vector Machine (MVRVM) is applied to both of the forecastings schemes. The general ETo model used is the 1985 Hargreaves Equation which requires only minimum and maximum daily air temperatures and is thus well suited to regions lacking more comprehensive climatic data. The utility and practicality of the forecasting methodology is demonstrated with an application to an irrigation project in Central Utah. To determine the advantage and suitability of the applied algorithm, another learning machine, the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), is used for comparison purposes. The robustness and stability of the proposed schemes are tested by the application of the bootstrap analysis. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.",Canal systems; Evapotranspiration; Forecasting; Hargreaves ET<sub>o</sub> equation; Irrigation; Machine learning; Water management,United States; Utah; Evapotranspiration; Hydraulic structures; Irrigation; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Statistical methods; Water management; Water supply; Air temperature; Canal systems; Climatic data; Delivery systems; Hargreaves; Hargreaves equations; Historical data; Irrigation projects; Learning machines; Limited climatic data; Machine learning algorithms; Machine-learning; Multi layer perceptron; Potential evapotranspiration; Relevance Vector Machine; Water demand; Weather data; Weather parameters; algorithm; bootstrapping; canal; evapotranspiration; irrigation system; numerical model; water demand; water management; water use; weather forecasting; Weather forecasting,Yes,Yes,empirical models,"climate & meteorology, vegetation indices",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0
2059,Jahanbani H.; El-Shafie A.H.,Application of artificial neural network in estimating monthly time series reference evapotranspiration with minimum and maximum temperatures,2011,10.1007/s10333-010-0219-1,"There are various methods for computing reference evapotranspiration (ETo) using meteorological data. However, such models tend to perform well for predicting ETo close to the mean, but do not keep accurate performance with extreme observations. It is recognized that the Penman-Monteith (PM) model has the best performance when rich data is available to calculate the ETo, which is not frequently available to a certain extent. In case of poor data, such as prediction of futuristic ETo while investigating climate change effect, although there are models other than PM like Hargreaves-Samani (HGS), the universal sustainability of these models are not quit proved. Accordingly, the calculation of ETo still required numerous research to reach accurate estimation of ETo specially when there is lacking for data to utilize PM method. Recently, methods based on artificial intelligence (AI) have been suggested to provide reliable prediction model for several application in engineering. This manuscript employed artificial neural network (ANN) for predicting daily ETo at Rasht city located northern part of Iran using minimum and maximum daily temperatures collected from 1975 to 1988 of the region. A comprehensive data analysis utilizing the daily time series, minimum and maximum temperatures and solar radiation (Tmin, Tmax and Rs), as input pattern to predict daily ETo at the current month and for the following month is proposed. The employed ANN model was feed forward backpropagation (FFBP) type with Bayesian regulation backpropagation. The mean square error, mean absolute error, mean absolute relative error and regression coefficient are the statistical performance indices used to evaluate the model accuracy. The results showed that the proposed ANN model could successfully be used to predict daily ETo using only maximum and minimum temperatures with significant level of accuracy. In addition, results show that the proposed ANN model outperforms HGS method. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.",Evapotranspiration; Feed forward backpropagation; Rich and poor data,Backpropagation; Climate change; Data reduction; Evapotranspiration; Forecasting; Mercury compounds; Meteorology; Neural networks; Optimization; Sun; Time series; Time series analysis; Water supply; Accurate estimation; Accurate performance; Artificial Neural Network; Bayesian regulation; Daily temperatures; Data analysis; Feedforward backpropagation; Hargreaves; Input patterns; Maximum temperature; Mean absolute error; Meteorological data; Model accuracy; Penman-Monteith; Prediction model; Reference evapotranspiration; Regression coefficient; Relative errors; Rich and poor data; Statistical performance; Climate models,Yes,Yes,"weather station, empirical models",climate & meteorology,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0
